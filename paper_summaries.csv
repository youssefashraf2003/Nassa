Mice in Bion-M 1 space mission: training and selection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136787/,"Abstract After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013). The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft.","For instance, the “air righting” test used to evaluate vestibular function involved holding and rotating individual mice cupped in the palms of the experimenter's hands prior to releasing the mouse into a safe fall. Pre-flight training of mice designated for in vivo studies Preliminary training and tests were performed with 42 mice for both the flight (SF) experiment and the corresponding vivarium control (SFV), and with 30 mice for the ground control (GC and GCV groups) experiment ( Table 3 ); 26 (62%) and 16 (53%) mice correspondingly fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The probabilities of mice displaying a good BP signal, running vigorously in the wheel, performing well in discriminative learning, and maintaining amicable interactions with cagemates should be treated as independent and therefore should be multiplied to get the joint probability."
"Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,"Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation.","In this study, we investigated cellular and molecular gene expression mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space, with an emphasis on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities in the pelvic girdle and proximal femur of 16-week-old C57BL/6J female mice. Among the muscles attaching to the ischium, the quadratus femoris plays an important “antigravity” role in maintaining a neutral hind-limb posture and can atrophy in microgravity , possibly explaining the high levels of bone loss we observed in the pelvis. We found increases in mRNA levels for several collagen molecules and laminin subunits, suggesting increased matrix remodeling, and significant up-regulation of mRNA for matrix metalloproteinases 1, 3, and 10 in flight samples compared to ground controls, while MMP inhibitors showed no statistically significant alterations in expression ( Fig."
Stem Cell Health and Tissue Regeneration in Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988870/,"Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity.","This unique environment disrupts key mechanisms such as mitochondrial biogenesis, liver metabolism, intestinal homeostasis, and stem cell differentiation, with profound implications for human health, particularly during prolonged space travel ( Table 1 ). Additionally, changes observed in endothelial cell behavior and multi-organ homeostasis highlight microgravity’s potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine and deepen our understanding of human physiology in extreme environments. Microgravity also holds significant promise for personalized medicine by facilitating progress in regenerative therapies, immune-based treatments, and approaches to managing chronic diseases."
Microgravity Reduces the Differentiation and Regenerative Potential of Embryonic Stem Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998608/,"Abstract Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs. Keywords: adipose-derived stem cell, microgravity culture, polystyrene microsphere, collagen microsphere, multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cell","However, although routine two-dimensional cultures allow hASCs to expand easily, these conditions adversely affect the proliferation of cells with higher multipotent properties, reducing the usual proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs to only approximately 1% [ 19 ]. Seven days of polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures under static conditions produced an increased number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to polystyrene dish cultures, and those under dynamic conditions exhibited a much higher number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. These results clearly revealed a positive influence of microspheres on the selective proliferation of SSEA-3(+) cells, especially in those experiments combined with a microgravity environment. In addition, as a biodegradable biomaterial, collagen has the advantage that such beads may be clinically administered into a target organ together with hASCs; it may even augment hASC survival and functionality after transplantation by acting as a biological cell scaffold [ 1 , 42 ]."
Microgravity validation of a novel system for RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real time PCR analysis of gene expression on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5587110/,"A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. The WetLab-2 facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.","Overall, the on-orbit process of total RNA isolation and gene expression analysis is accomplished in a span of approximately 3 h without the requirement for a highly experienced user and provides a new capability to ISS that will greatly expand the limits of possible on-orbit science. Specifically, because PCR consists of repeated cycles of rapid heating and cooling, lack of gravity-induced convection mixing in microgravity may limit heat transfer throughout the sample to only conduction which may require longer denaturation and annealing/extension times. Through these experiments, we have demonstrated that qPCR can be successfully performed in the microgravity environment of space and developed an system of molecular biology tools and reagents for extracting and quantitatively analyzing RNA from biological samples on-orbit and generating RT-qPCR Ct data (See photos of actual on-orbit operations in Fig 5 )."
Spaceflight Modulates the Expression of Key Oxidative Stress and Cell Cycle Related Genes in Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396460/,"Abstract Spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice.","Factors related to experimental protocol also important to consider when interpreting gene expression findings from this experiment include the fixed duration of the mission (15 days), sample recovery only after animals were returned to Earth (3+ hours after landing), and the fact that ground control animals were housed in flight-matched habitats but were not exposed to similar forces as the flight mice encountered during launch and landing. As the scope of our investigation focused on RT-PCR, additional studies are needed to elucidate how spaceflight-induced oxidative stress may mediate cell cycle/growth and function, to gain deeper insight into how the cardiovascular system responds to the space environment and recovers after return to Earth. Furthermore, because the heart consists of multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages, each with a discrete gene expression profile [ 53 ], future experiments could focus on spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular source of specific gene expression changes, as well as the regulation of protein expression together with cardiac function."
Dose- and Ion-Dependent Effects in the Oxidative Stress Response to Space-Like Radiation Exposure in the Skeletal System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666799/,"16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56 Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET ( 137 Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56 Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56 Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56 Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.","In this study, the structural decrement affected by 56 Fe (200 cGy) was resolved one year after exposure due to the expected age-related decline in sham-control animals changes over time ( Table 1 ), likely the product of age-induced elevations of osteoclasts overtaking waning bone formation by osteoblasts [ 45 ]. Furthermore, exogenous SOD effectively protected osteoprogenitors from low-LET radiation damage, but only minimally from 56 Fe at 100 cGy, and not at all from 56 Fe at 200 cGy. Taken together, these findings indicate excess extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibited growth, and that oxidative stress is possibly the main mechanism involved in low-LET radiodamage to osteoprogenitors; in contrast, high-LET species likely affect the cells via additional detrimental mechanisms, such as double-strand DNA breaks. In sum, we showed the ability of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) to mitigate the adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays (used for the low-LET radiation), but not to an equivalent dose of high-LET 56 Fe. Our results strengthen the potential application of SOD as a countermeasure for low-LET irradiation-induced damage to marrow stem cells and osteoprogenitors."

High-precision method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae to assess bone quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6222041/,"In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups ( n = 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.","While the absolute value of strain to failure will be influenced by any machine compliance, the general level of agreement and small degree of scatter suggests that bone tissue does indeed fail at a narrow range of strain under cyclic loading, and that our protocol was successful in reducing the variation in strain across different specimens. Furthermore, unlike in the Brouwers literature protocol, we had no loss of specimens, enabled by repeatable specimen preparation (e.g. 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces) and uniform loading of specimen surfaces (e.g. spherically-seated platen), which further improves statistical power, and can be implemented for monotonic testing or fatigue testing of small-animal vertebrae. However, the extra effort improves the ability to detect small differences across treatment groups without using a large number of animals, which is advantageous both ethically and also logistically when sample sizes are inherently limited (e.g. space flight experiments)."
Effects of ex vivo ionizing radiation on collagen structure and whole-bone mechanical properties of mouse vertebrae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813909/,"Abstract Bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to sterilization (~35,000 Gy). To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.","These results demonstrate that the monotonic strength of murine vertebral bodies was only diminished when exposed to ionizing radiation at or above 17,000 Gy. While the relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was greater for all radiation groups compared to the control, the increase in crosslinks measured at lower doses (50 and 1,000 Gy) did not coincide with the observed reduction in mechanical strength ( Figure 4 ). For the first time, we have demonstrated the effect of irradiation on whole-bones (with both cortical and trabecular tissue) across a spectrum of clinically-relevant doses (i.e. radiation therapy at 50 Gy to allograft sterilization at 35,000 Gy) with both monotonic and fatigue mechanical tests, as well as parallel collagen biochemical assays. Previously, numerous studies attributed the increase in non-enzymatic crosslink concentration as the primary mechanism for degraded bone strength, specifically in applications of natural aging [ 24 , 36 , 41 ], drug treatments [ 42 ], irradiation sterilization [ 13 ], and diseases such as osteoporosis [ 43 ] and diabetes [ 26 , 44 – 47 ]."
Absence of gamma-sarcoglycan alters the response of p70S6 kinase to mechanical perturbation in murine skeletal muscle,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4095884/,"Abstract Background The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is located at the sarcolemma of muscle fibers, providing structural integrity. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive, γ-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of γ-sarcoglycan. Methods We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of γ-sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and γ-sarcoglycan-null (γ-SG -/- ) mice.","Identification of major pathways that directly regulate gene expression and protein synthesis/degradation demonstrate that multiple inputs (mechanical, chemical, and metabolic) can converge on final common pathways for muscle growth and adaptation (reviewed in [ 45 ]). Further, as previously shown, passive stretch causes greater Ca 2+ influx into myotubes lacking members of the SG complex [ 17 ], raising the possibility that the mechanical signal transduction pathways we evaluated previously may be modulated not only by the SG complex, but also by additional channels in the sarcolemma. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the details of crosstalk between SG-dependent and integrin-dependent signaling pathways, as well as the role of calcium in these signaling cascades.Based on our findings, we position γSG as a mechanosensor, schematized in Figure 6 , that is important for transient ERK1/2 activation during active contractions, as well as modulation of p70S6K activation during passive stretch."
AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have overlapping functions in pollen development and pollen tube growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3040128/,"Abstract Background Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. Compared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched pollen tube tips. Conclusions These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking during pollen tube growth that cannot be fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members.","Using the bioinformatics tool MetaOmGraph ( http://www.metnetdb.org ) [ 25 , 26 ] to determine the pairwise Pearsons correlation value between the expression patterns of all of the 57 AtRab genes (Additional file 1 , Table S1), we found that among the four AtRabDs, only the expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated. Third, computational analysis of public microarray data, together with studies of the expression pattern directed by the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c promoters, indicated that both are widely expressed in most organs and several cell types, with high expression in pollen. This is consistent with the idea that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are required for vesicle trafficking in multiple cell types, and that the highest demand for this process may be in pollen and pollen tubes, in order to optimally support the large secretory requirement of these very rapidly elongating cells."
TNO1 is involved in salt tolerance and vacuolar trafficking in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177255/,"Abstract The Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity.","In addition, myosin-related proteins, a putative ATP-binding protein, and tethering factors including USO1 in yeast, tgolgin-1 in mouse, and gigantin in human were identified with high significance, primarily due to the presence of long coiled-coil regions in these proteins. Phenotype of the tno1 Knockout Mutant To determine the function of TNO1, the tno1 mutant was isolated and four major phenotypes were identified: sensitivity to high salt and osmotic stress, partial secretion of some vacuolar proteins, mislocalization of SYP61, and delayed BFA compartment formation in cotyledon cells. Extensive investigations of cation transporters in yeast, plants, and mammalian cells have shown that cation/H + antiporters in the Golgi, TGN, endosome, and PVC regulate the pH and cation concentration in these organelles, affecting vesicle trafficking, and knockdown of VHAa1 in Arabidopsis also leads to increased salt sensitivity ( Brett et al., 2002 , 2005 ; Nakamura et al., 2005 ; Pardo et al., 2006 ; Fuji et al., 2007 ; Krebs et al., 2010 )."
Functional redundancy between trans-Golgi network SNARE family members in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11500582/,"In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans -Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP ( Arabidopsis thaliana G lycosyl T ransferase- L ike P rotein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. As single atgtlp−/− mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions.","The general role of TGN is to receive proteins modified in Golgi and direct them either for vacuoles, the plasma membrane or for secretion ( Griffiths and Simons 1986 ) and therefore, this organelle is considered to be an important hub in the membrane traffic system, where cargo proteins are sorted, before being dispatched for their next destination ( Keller and Simons 1997 ). Despite the fact that characteristics of AtGTLP, such as its trans -Golgi localization, type II topology and the presence of O -FUT-like conserved domain, seem to agree with the assumption that it is a member of the glycosyltransferase family, the data currently available are not enough to conclusively state that AtGTLP is a GT or a type of FUT, precisely. Under standard growth conditions, atgtlp−/− single mutant displayed phenotype indistinguishable from Col-0 plants and one possible explanation for this result is that AtGTLP and related proteins with high amino acid sequence similarity to AtGTLP might have redundant functions."
Root growth movements: Waving and skewing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5387210/,"Abstract Background The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Results We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering factor localized at the trans -Golgi network, affects root skewing.","Owing to anomalies such as these, Wasteneys (2004) proposed that CFR could arise due to torsional handedness inherent to roots, and the correlation between CFR and MT array orientations could result from signaling between the MT array and cell wall machinery. Disrupting MT arrays therefore affects cellulose synthesis, deposition and orientation, while conversely, inhibiting cellulose synthase activity causes defects in MT arrays [ 69 , 70 ], which can potentially affect directional growth patterns [ 18 ]. Since CESTRIN does not affect the bulk secretory and endocytic routes, the SYP61-decorated domain of the TGN and its associated proteins such as TNO1 seem to be crucial for cellulose deposition and, indirectly, MT stability."
Gravitropism and lateral root emergence are dependent on the trans-Golgi network protein TNO1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4642138/,"Abstract The trans -Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin transport proteins.","The gravitropic bending defect in tno1 roots and hypocotyls can be rescued by exogenous application of 1-NAA and IAA, perhaps by overriding endogenous auxin levels and routes of polar auxin transport, thus restoring auxin responses. Since TNO1 associates with the SNARE machinery at the TGN, and its loss causes a mis-localization of SYP61 as well as vacuolar sorting defects ( Kim and Bassham, 2011 ), the SYP41/SYP61/VTI12 complex in conjunction with TNO1 may regulate auxin transport by affecting auxin transporter trafficking and turnover. Secretory cargo, including various cell wall remodeling enzymes, traffics via the Golgi and TGN toward the extracellular space ( Foresti and Denecke, 2008 ; Toyooka et al., 2009 ; De Caroli et al., 2011 ), in a pathway potentially mediated by SYP61 ( Drakakaki et al., 2012 )."

The Drosophila SUN protein Spag4 cooperates with the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin to maintain association of the basal body and spermatid nucleus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915878/,"Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway.","Tates, PhD thesis, Leiden University, 1971; Tokuyasu, 1974 ) have shown that the initial cap component of the dense complex forms in a tight compartment between the nuclear membranes proper and a layer of closely apposed ER tubule. The overall similar behavior of p50:GFP and Yuri in the spag4 mutant supports the hypothesis of direct interaction with dynein, but at the same time indicates that Yuri is not directly associated with the dynactin component per se, because the precise localizations of Yuri and p50:GFP on the developing BB in the spag4 -null mutant are distinctly different (compare Fig. Although BB behavior has not been examined for a mutation to Pros-α6T (a testis-specific proteasome subunit), nevertheless, curled, mislocalized spermatid nuclei are found in this mutant along with aberrant actin cone formation and failed individualization ( Zhong and Belote, 2007 )."
Toll mediated infection response is altered by gravity and spaceflight in Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901686/,"Abstract Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.","In one arm, Psh, moderated by suppression from Nec, senses fungal virulence factors and other danger signals, leading to activation of the Spätzle Processing Enzyme (SPE), cleavage of the Spz prodomain, and binding of processed Spz to the Toll transmembrane receptor . Adults Raised during Spaceflight have an Altered Transcriptional Profile Comparing the transcription profiles of uninfected space and Earth flies provides valuable insights into the biological processes affected by the µg environment and thus generates clues as to the origin of the differing effects on Imd and Toll mediated responses. Six genes associated with apoptosis are upregulated: starvin , which is a cochaperone associated with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) ; the caspase Damm , which can trigger apoptosis when overexpressed ; Pdk1 , a serine/threonine kinase that is a negative regulator of apoptosis ; Drep-3 , one of four Drosophila DNA fragmentation factor-related proteins ; dream , a serine threonine rich caspase ; and Rab3-GEF , a Ras superfamily member predicted to regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis ."

GeneLab database analyses suggest long-term impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system by the activation of FYN through reactive oxygen species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6387434/,"As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56 Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN , which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis.","Through our unbiased analysis we were able to suggest: 1) that, consistent with the dose data, the majority of the radiation experienced on the ISS is potentially from protons ( Figure 4 D–F and Figure 2 ), a novel response mechanism of the cardiovascular system to prevent damage caused by space radiation through the activation of FYN . More specifically, FYN was found to be upregulated within each group of the key genes associated with each dataset providing an overall predicted inhibition of ROS and cell death, while causing an activation of inflammation due to space radiation. As discussed above, in a normal response with other types of external damage causing oxidative stress on the cardiovascular system, it has been shown that FYN will be activated and act as a negative feedback regulator to protect the cardiac tissue [ 36 ]."
FAIRness and usability for open-access omics data systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371294/,"Abstract Omics data sharing is crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen a huge rise in collaborative analysis systems, databases, and knowledge bases for omics and other systems biology data. We assessed the “FAIRness” of NASA’s GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) along with four similar kinds of systems in the research omics data domain, using 14 FAIRness metrics. We relate our experiences implementing semantic integration of omics data from some of the assessed systems for federated querying and retrieval functions, given their shortcomings in data interoperability. Finally, we propose two new principles that Big Data system developers, in particular, should consider for maximizing data accessibility.","For example, the concept of zero or very low-gravity experimental conditions appears in at least 5 different, widely-used biomedical vocabularies: SNOMED CT, MeSH, Read Codes Clinical Terms, Psychology Ontology, PLOS Thesaurus, and FAST Topical Facet, with varying language for the concept (“weightlessness” vs. As such, we resorted to manually creating semantic maps of these schemas for use in our system; queries generated via the GLDS or its RESTful search API are executed against the mapped schema concepts, and matching records are shown in a common object model representation ( Figure 4 ). The research community should recognize the value of federated system functions like the querying function that the GLDS offers, and urge all open access repositories and data systems to make their metadata schemas available to all according to the aforementioned FAIR principles."
NASA GeneLab platform utilized for biological response to space radiation in animal models,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7072278/,"Abstract Background: Ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is one of the major risk factors that will impact the health of astronauts on extended missions outside the protective effects of the Earth’s magnetic field. Methods: We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based and spaceflight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. A range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies, as well as samples flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total doses of 1.0 mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Conclusions: We provided a summary of how the GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR exposures.","Because the GeneLab Data System contains spaceflight transcriptomic data from mice and tissues flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) for various time durations, we were able to obtain accumulated space radiation doses from 1 to 30 mGy. To obtain doses that will be more relevant to long-term deep space travel [ 7 , 14 ], we combined our analysis with simulated space radiation ground experiments performed in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory [ 24 ]. These experiments were performed on both mice and in vitro cell cultures with single ions (protons, 56 Fe, and 26 Si) at doses from 100 to 1000 mGy. By combining 25 GeneLab datasets over these doses, this work represents the first time a study has provided a comprehensive biological analysis and produced relevant and novel results indicating which relevant biological processes are being regulated as a function of space radiation exposure. The ability to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA and DNA datasets has been performed previously on the basis of the assumption of a homogeneous genomic sample for example from a tumor [ 70 ], whereas the sporadic and stochastic nature of HZE exposure is expected to result in random damage throughout the genome [ 72 ]."
Circulating miRNA spaceflight signature reveals targets for countermeasure development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8441986/,"SUMMARY We have identified and validated a spaceflight-associated microRNA (miRNA) signature that is shared by rodents and humans in response to simulated, short-duration and long-duration spaceflight. Previous studies have identified miRNAs that regulate rodent responses to spaceflight in low-Earth orbit, and we have confirmed the expression of these proposed spaceflight-associated miRNAs in rodents reacting to simulated spaceflight conditions. Moreover, astronaut samples from the NASA Twins Study confirmed these expression signatures in miRNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of key spaceflight-associated miRNAs, we utilized antagomirs to inhibit their expression and successfully rescue simulated deep-space-radiation-mediated damage in human 3D vascular constructs.","Previous studies have identified miRNAs that regulate rodent responses to spaceflight in low-Earth orbit, and we have confirmed the expression of these proposed spaceflight-associated miRNAs in rodents reacting to simulated spaceflight conditions.

Machine learning algorithm to characterize antimicrobial resistance associated with the International Space Station surface microbiome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9400218/,"Abstract Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for long-distance space travel. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking–1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). Conclusion Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.","Our previous research uncovered the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump [ 44 ], belonging to RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division) protein family, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [ 20 ]. Third, phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing data obtained from traditional antibiotic tests generated for biosafety level 2 strains were compared with the computational approaches that predicted the presence of the AMR genes, showing an excellent agreement for the antibiotics tested (Fig. Rather than the gather-and-return sampling model currently used for the ISS, new developments in sequencing technologies in combination with Artificial Intelligence will allow for efficient analysis onboard the ISS and in long-duration space missions."
Extraterrestrial Gynecology: Could Spaceflight Increase the Risk of Developing Cancer in Female Astronauts? An Updated Review,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9267413/,"Abstract Outer space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most significant hazards to the health of astronauts. Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of the research that has been carried out related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.","The current data reveal a scarcity of knowledge about the impact of space radiation and microgravity on gynecologic cancer, as there have been insufficient numbers of female astronauts exposed to long-duration, low-dose rate, and proton and heavy ion radiation to reliably determine the impact on the female reproductive system. With the upcoming Artemis missions set to place the first females on the Moon, there will be longer duration of exposures to both microgravity and space radiation; hence, the influence of flight length on risks related to gynecological cancers will demand a larger focus in ensuring astronaut safety during flight and postflight. Therefore, these tissues may be one of the best to study to determine space radiation related exposures."
Muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression during spaceflight is linked to a metabolic crosstalk in both the liver and the muscle in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9576569/,"The muscle and the liver are among the most affected tissues during spaceflight and their relationships in response to space exposure have never been studied. We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice on NASA RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceflight using GSEA, ORA, and sparse partial least square-differential analysis. A specific gene cluster expression pattern in the liver strongly correlated with glucose sparing and an energy-saving response affecting high energy demand process gene expression such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation in the muscle. Our results show that impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver and muscle atrophy gene expression are two paired events during spaceflight, for which dietary changes represent a possible countermeasure.","We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice on NASA RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceflight using GSEA, ORA, and sparse partial least square-differential analysis.

Chromosomal positioning and epigenetic architecture influence DNA methylation patterns triggered by galactic cosmic radiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10789781/,"Abstract Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET ( 56 Fe, 28 Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage.","Finally, in NASA Twins Study, despite observing minor genome-wide DNA methylation changes, the gene enrichment analysis showed that during flight genes involved in the response to platelet-derived growth factor and T cell differentiation, and activation pathways in both CD4 and CF8 cells were enriched. Additionally, from that point, we started to observe a similar DMP chromosomal frequency pattern, suggesting the higher radiation vulnerability to occur differentially methylated sites as well as higher DNA methylation changes, especially among internally located promoters and enhancers sites. Although, never investigated for 56 Fe and 28 Si particles, based on similar experiments performed using 1 Gy for 11 B and 1.2 Gy for 20 Ne (LET 150 keV/µm and 171 keV/µm, respectively; Energy beam 8 MeV/n and 47 MeV/n, respectively), we could suspect that all of investigated particles by Kennedy et al., should penetrate the whole nucleus width, therefore, it is unlikely to observe a Bragg peak in the middle and all other nuclear layers 50 ."
"A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, Part 2: Host extracellular to systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10772081/,"The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases.","Here we describe and review the latest knowledge about the viral effect on our physiology, as well as the latest research on relevant whole-body metabolism pathways, circulating biological components (e.g., RNA, cytokine, hormones, etc.), and affected organ systems and their physiological adaptations consequent to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we have attempted to capture the prevalent host responses, as well as highlight gaps of knowledge that could be addressed with future research. We have also touched on relevant biochemical targets with potential for mitigating COVID-19 in the human host, and we will describe current and in-development treatment modalities that affect these in Part 3 of our review."
Aging and putative frailty biomarkers are altered by spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166946/,"Abstract Human space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts’ health, leading to molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions.","Nevertheless, despite acute events such as space motion sickness and autonomic imbalance resolving after astronaut’s return to ground, the effects of these aging-like alterations might be clinically manifest in a chronic exposure scenario, like a long-duration mission to Mars, and could potentially trigger chronic disease development. This notion is not novel, for example, a recent report showed the development of distinct mutational profiles in astronauts 66 ; on these bases, it would be worth monitoring these biomarkers for longer timepoints after reentry, and to exclude the possibility that they underlie any sub-clinical disease development. Importantly, while our results confirm past observations that mitochondrial and metabolic changes are conserved features of space flown tissues and organisms 3 , they also demonstrate that the functional changes via metabolic flux are more important than the simple global up versus down changes often employed with reductionist approaches."
Space radiation damage rescued by inhibition of key spaceflight associated miRNAs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166944/,"Abstract Our previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with spaceflight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop countermeasure treatments to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p ( i.e ., antagomirs). Significant reduction of inflammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans.","A recent paper has described the presence of miR-125b in osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs) 71 and in bone matrix where it hampers osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by targeting PRDM1 (PR domain zinc finger protein 1), thus suggesting that miR-125b might have an active role in the development of vascular calcifications 72 . Involvement of cellular programs from the innate immune response is a possibility, since immune-associated genes seem to be heavily regulated by space radiation and miRNAs. The effects of the antagomir cocktail on suppressing DNA repair indicates a much earlier time of action, likely upstream of the rescue of angiogenesis or the protection of mature vessels. Curiously, GCR suppresses most of the pathways associated with cellular senescence curated based on data from fibroblasts, renal epithelial cells and adipocytes induced to senescence by different stimuli, including X-ray irradiation, oncogene overexpression, antiretroviral drug or hyperinsulinemia 50 , 51 ."
Ethical considerations for the age of non-governmental space exploration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166968/,"Abstract Mounting ambitions and capabilities for public and private, non-government sector crewed space exploration bring with them an increasingly diverse set of space travelers, raising new and nontrivial ethical, legal, and medical policy and practice concerns which are still relatively underexplored. In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations. Subject terms: Ethics, Medical research","While governmental oversight has historically governed space activities, the emergence of non-governmental initiatives calls for unified ethical guidelines, safeguarding human well-being during selection, research, and decision-making in space. Since non-governmental outfits are not bound by the same rules in the same way, we as a community must ensure that the guidelines we set will guide space exploration according to the highest ethical and medical standards for humans that are currently possible, including selection of SOs, medical research ranging from human subject research to discussion of in-flight triage decisions. The added difficulties of non-universal terminology referring to different kinds of space travelers and of making guidelines sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential spaceflight endeavors will add further layers of complexity."
Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000411/,"Abstract While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll , suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.","52 Similarly in our study with ground-reared fly host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 1 ) as well as in vivo, the current results indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following infection of bacteria altered by spaceflight and LSMMG are likely due to changes to the pathogen, rather than a difference in host immune response of ground-reared flies. This suggests that bacteria growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between spaceflight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not find significant changes in host immune-related genes after infection with spaceflight sample compared to ground sample in wild-type ground-reared flies (Fig."
Prolonged Exposure to Microgravity Reduces Cardiac Contractility and Initiates Remodeling in Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787258/,"Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans.

Regulation of plant gravity sensing and signaling by the actin cytoskeleton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716943/,"In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.","[Conclusion Not Found; Full Article Summary]: doi: 10.3389/fpls.2021.777119 Bundling up the Role of the Actin Cytoskeleton in Primary Root Growth Judith García-González Judith García-González 1 Department of Experimental Plant Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czechia 2 Laboratory of Hormonal Regulations in Plants, Institute of Experimental Botany, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czechia Find articles by Judith García-González 1, 2, * , Kasper van Gelderen Kasper van Gelderen 3 Plant Ecophysiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands Find articles by Kasper van Gelderen 3, * Author information Article notes Copyright and License information 1 Department of Experimental Plant Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czechia 2 Laboratory of Hormonal Regulations in Plants, Institute of Experimental Botany, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czechia 3 Plant Ecophysiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands Edited by: Verena Ibl, University of Vienna, Austria Reviewed by: Rosemary White, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia; Mateusz Majda, John Innes Centre, United Kingdom ✉ *Correspondence: Judith García-González, garciagj@natur.cuni.cz * Kasper van Gelderen, k.vangelderen@uu.nl This article was submitted to Technical Advances in Plant Science, a section of the journal Frontiers in Plant Science Received 2021 Sep 14; Accepted 2021 Nov 11; Collection date 2021. There are clear differences between RAM zones ( Figure 1 ); to start with, meristematic cells show a pattern of dense, highly disorganized actin, characterized by relatively low levels of bundling and reduced longitudinal orientation and parallel arrangement of microfilaments ( Wang et al., 2004 ; Arieti and Staiger, 2020 ). This hypothesis is supported by the negative effect of Latrunculin B-mediated actin depolymerization on the dynamics of CESA-containing Golgi bodies in roots or the decreased delivery and uptake of pectins and other polysaccharide components of the cell wall observed in other plant tissues ( Baluška et al., 2002 ; Leucci et al., 2006 ; Sampathkumar et al., 2013 ). Actin nucleators promote de novo or branched filament assembly; actin-capping/severing proteins regulate the dynamics of actin filaments by mediating its turnover; network protein (NET) family members link actin and the endomembrane system; myosin motor proteins facilitate actin-based vesicle and organ motility. It is possible that higher-order mutants are needed to unveil a role of villins in primary root length determination, but the above-mentioned defects in root bending and twisting of villin mutants indicates that they are required for the fine tuning of root directional growth ( van der Honing et al., 2012 ; Zou et al., 2019 )."
HLB1 Is a Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain-Containing Protein That Operates at the Intersection of the Exocytic and Endocytic Pathways at the TGN/EE in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4826010/,A forward-genetic screen for Arabidopsis mutants hypersensitive to latrunculin B identifies HLB1 as a plant-specific protein that functions in post-Golgi traffic.,"Although HLB1 is encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene and the hlb1 mutant showed clear defects in exocytosis and heightened sensitivity to LatB , the mild root phenotypes of hlb1 in the absence of LatB suggests that HLB1 could function redundantly with other unknown nonhomologous proteins in plant development. The fact that hlb1 displayed strong protein trafficking and seedling growth defects in response to low nanomolar doses of LatB supports the hypothesis that HLB1 is a crucial component of post-Golgi traffic that is strongly dependent on the maintenance of an intact actin cytoskeleton. The shared phenotypes of hlb1 with other exocytic and endocytic trafficking mutants such as ben1 , bex1 , and bex5 indicate that the TGN / EE -localized HLB1 protein lies at a crucial step where exocytic and endocytic pathways converge and therefore represent a class of plant-specific membrane scaffolding proteins likely involved in linking post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton."

Brassinosteroids inhibit autotropic root straightening by modifying filamentous-actin organization and dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010715/,"Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic ( Medicago truncatula ) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.","Because actin inhibitors such as LatB or mutations to genes encoding actin itself led to stronger root gravitropic curvature ( Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002 ; Hou et al., 2003 ; Kato et al., 2010 ; Lanza et al., 2012 ), it was proposed that the unrestrained sedimentation of amyloplasts may amplify the gravity sensing signal leading to a more robust graviresponse ( Blancaflor, 2013 ). thaliana myosin XI mutants ( Okamoto et al., 2015 ) and results presented here, suggest a more prominent role for actin in the graviresponse phase, and more specifically in the autotropic straightening response that enables plant organs to correct their orientation ( Stankovic et al., 1998a ; Stanković et al., 1998b ). While our results expand on these previous observations, experiments with a clinostat implicated eBL as a potential regulator of autotropism, and like previous results with LatB-treated roots, provide an alternative explanation of why this hormone has an apparent promotive effect on gravitropism."
Cell type-specific imaging of calcium signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana seedling roots using GCaMP3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503278/,"Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca 2+ ] cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca 2+ ] cyt .","While this has proven effective for marking developmental regions along the longitudinal axis of the root [ 5 , 27 ], specifying a region of interest to designate root tissue/cell types along the radial axis for fluorescence-based measurements of [Ca 2+ ] cyt can be problematic because this does not guarantee complete separation of signals from adjacent cell types. Because fer mutants displayed a high incidence of cortical cell rupture when compared to wild type after exposure to NaCl, it is tempting to speculate that earlier onset of [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients in the cortex revealed by the PEP:GCaMP3 -expressing lines could be a mechanism to maintain root growth integrity. In this regard, it is noteworthy that columella-targeted GCaMP3 lines did not exhibit a [Ca 2+ ] cyt increase after Al 3+ treatment while those lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the endodermis lacked a [Ca 2+ ] cyt response to NaCl. With the establishment of response patterns from the cell type specific GCaMP3 lines when exposed to various chemical treatments, investigation into unique aspects of different root tissues/cells, such as signal propagation direction and response intensity, can be more readily explored."
Spatial and temporal localization of SPIRRIG and WAVE/SCAR reveal roles for these proteins in actin-mediated root hair development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8364238/,SPIRRIG and SCAR/WAVE are molecular determinants of actin-mediated root hair development in Arabidopsis.,"Furthermore, the Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) Nbea homolog SEL-2 was demonstrated to function in endomembrane trafficking in polarized epithelial cells based on the finding that sel-2 mutants mistarget proteins normally found in the apical cell surface to the basolateral surface ( de Souza et al., 2007 ). The absence of tip-directed SEC-RFP gradients in spi root hairs shows that, as in mammals, plant BEACH domain-containing proteins are required for the proper targeting of molecular cargo to points of polarized cell growth. The weakening of BRK1-mRuby3 fluorescence coinciding with SPI-YPet accumulation, and the persistence of SPI-YPet signal in spi root hair tips, provides indirect evidence that SPI might play a role in mediating BRK1 stability or localized clustering at the plasma membrane of the RHID."
Microgravity Stress: Bone and Connective Tissue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11579474/,"Abstract Long-duration spaceflight creates a variety of stresses due to the unique environment, which can lead to compromised functioning of the skeletal and immune systems.

S. aureus MscL is a pentamer in vivo but of variable stoichiometries in vitro: implications for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998437/,Detergent-induced rearrangements of membrane-protein subunits explain why two MscL channel stoichiometries have been resolved by X-ray crystallography - but S. aureus MscL is truly a pentamer in vivo.,"Indeed, the best-studied mechanosensitive channel is from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. Although the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL has been well studied, the simple issue of how many subunits it has is hotly debated. Here we show that the channel is actually pentameric in vivo and that the detergent used to solubilize the protein can rearrange the complexes from pentamers to tetramers."
Manipulating the permeation of charged compounds through the MscL nanovalve.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005423/,"Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices. In this study, we used in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of charged molecules.","The C terminus of MscL appears to be tolerant to truncation and insertion of tags ( 16 , 17 , 35 ) and thus might be an appropriate location for the addition of such a PEG label, allowing for a cytoplasmic-side-out orientation in a liposome reconstitution system. Furthermore, the addition of a PEG group is not likely to be deleterious to the vesicular device; PEG lipids are used routinely in what are termed “stealth vesicles,” because they allow for the evasion of opsonization and uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, and thus have an extended half-life within an organism ( 36 , 37 ). Because it has the potential to release therapeutic compounds within or near target tissues on specific stimuli, a controllable MscL nanovalve with high efflux efficiency would be a step toward a selective and efficient nanocarrier."

It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated.","[Conclusion Not Found; Full Article Summary]: doi: 10.1002/pro.686 The oligomeric state of the truncated mechanosensitive channel of large conductance shows no variance in vivo Irene Iscla Irene Iscla 1 Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas Find articles by Irene Iscla 1 , Robin Wray Robin Wray 1 Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas Find articles by Robin Wray 1 , Paul Blount Paul Blount 1 Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas Find articles by Paul Blount 1, * Author information Article notes Copyright and License information 1 Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas ✉ * Correspondence to: Paul Blount, Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas, TX 75290-9040. Using crosslinking, sedimentation equilibrium centrifugations and light scattering, we concluded that on solubilization with the detergent n -dodecyl- N , N -dimethylamine- N -oxide (LDAO), which was used to obtain the crystal structure, the channel reversibly reorganizes as a tetramer; in contrast, TritonX-100 and pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C 8 E 5 ) detergents did not alter stoichiometry. 10 Recently, using a new technique coined oligomer characterization by addition of mass (OCAM), the Rees' group confirmed that both MtMscL, and full length (FL) SaMscL are pentamers when solubilized in n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM); but they also showed that a SaMscL with the C-terminal deletion, as used in the crystallographic study, was heterogeneous in its oligomeric state, existing as both pentamers and tetramers. As previously described, bacteria expressing the different constructs were given an osmotic shock in the presence of copper phenanthroline; this removes cellular reducing agents such as glutathione while adding an oxidant. As detergent solubilization is a critical and necessary step to obtain membrane proteins for crystallization and other biophysical and structural studies, where possible, a complementary set of data assessing the oligomeric state in vivo seems advisable."
Three routes to modulate the pore size of the MscL channel/nanovalve,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289768/,"Abstract MscL is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment. In addition, the fact that it can be genetically modified, expressed, isolated, and manipulated has led to its proposed use as a triggered nanovalve for various functions including sensors within microelectronic array chips, as well as vesicular-based targeted drug release. X-ray crystallography reveals a homo-pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly.","mutated the pairs of leucines predicted to face each other to cysteines within the consensus motif; these formed cross bridges between subunits, as anticipated from the authors’ proposed structure, yet normal channel activity was observed. coli MscL revealed a significant difference in the structure of the end of TM2, which was explained by several possibilities, including that the c-terminus of each channel subunit might not assemble into CB but, instead, fold toward the membrane interface establishing specific tertiary contacts with TM2. As seen in Figure 1b , and consistent with a previous study, 23 the extent of cross linking in individual MscL complexes varies, giving a ladder of MscL monomers to pentamers in a non-reduced SDS PAGE gel as visualized by Western."
The dynamics of protein-protein interactions between domains of MscL at the cytoplasmic-lipid interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3508904/,"Abstract The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is one of the best characterized mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how proteins can sense and transduce mechanical forces. The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2 ci ), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating.","17 Finally, we use an in vivo approach in which the membrane proteins are not solubilized prior to being resuspended in SDS running buffer; hence disulfide bridges cannot form in mild detergents that would preserve the pentameric complex while possibly allowing more dynamic interactions not reflecting any normal physiological state. In addition to tilting, for TM1 several lines of evidence also suggest a clockwise “corkscrewing” of TM1 of almost 180°, as would be observed from the periplasm; these lines of evidence include EPR experiments, 20 disulfide trapping experiments within the pore 9 and between TM1 and TM2 upon gating, 17 accessibility and gating influences of the sulfhydryl reagent MTSET + on TM cysteine mutants, 21 , 22 and the engineering of heavy metal binding sites within the pore region. Thus, overall the double cysteine mutants that bridge at high efficiency fall in two main categories: those that are predicted to be in close proximity from the closed structure and do lock the channel closed under oxidizing conditions, and those interactions consistent with the predicted sliding and tilting of these regions upon gating that show stabilized subconducting states when oxidized."
The MscS and MscL families of mechanosensitive channels act as microbial emergency release valves,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3430326/,"Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life-threatening changes that can occur is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly a function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physiological roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function.","[Conclusion Not Found; Full Article Summary]: doi: 10.1128/JB.00576-12 The MscS and MscL Families of Mechanosensitive Channels Act as Microbial Emergency Release Valves Ian R Booth Ian R Booth a School of Medical Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom Find articles by Ian R Booth a , Paul Blount Paul Blount b Department of Physiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, USA Find articles by Paul Blount b, ✉ Author information Copyright and License information a School of Medical Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom b Department of Physiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, USA ✉ Address correspondence to Paul Blount, paul.blount@utsouthwestern.edu . For example, a transition from seawater (∼1,000 mosM) to freshwater (10 to 100 mosM) reflects a change in turgor of approximately 22 atm, simply due to the lowering of the external osmolarity (by the Van't Hoff Law, the osmotic pressure in atm, Π, in dilute solutions is calculated by the equation Π = RT ∑ c i , where R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and c i is the molar concentration of solute I; thus, 40 mosM = ∼1 atm). The assembled cytoplasmic domains in the homoheptamer form a large balloon-like structure that is delimited at the membrane surface by the entrance to the pore defined by the seven TM3A helices and at the base by a β barrel that is both narrow and lined with hydrophobic residues, such that it is unlikely that either water or solutes can pass. Except for the mycoplasma MscL domain structure noted above, it always contains the following conserved domains: an amphipathic α helix (S1) that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane, a highly conserved first transmembrane domain (TM1) that forms the pore constriction, a periplasmic loop, a second transmembrane domain (TM2) that faces the lipid membrane, and a linker that leads to a cytoplasmic α-helical bundle. THE RESILIENCE OF THE MscL PROTEIN ALLOWS IN VIVO GENETIC STUDIES TO DEFINE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT OCCUR UPON GATING Given that MscL is so highly conserved, both structurally and functionally, one might suspect that small changes would result in radically different phenotypes in channel activities."

Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11127935/,"Abstract Tardigrades, microscopic animals that survive a broad range of environmental stresses, express a unique set of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation. Here, we focus on the proteins belonging to the secreted family of tardigrade proteins termed secretory-abundant heat soluble (“SAHS”) proteins, and investigate their ability to protect diverse biological structures. Molecular dynamics simulation and comparative structural analysis suggest a model by which SAHS proteins may undergo a structural transition upon desiccation, in which removal of water and solutes from a large internal cavity in SAHS proteins destabilizes the beta-sheet structure.","In addition, we observed that the SAHS proteins undergo structural shift upon exposure to a desiccation-mimicking compound and used a diverse set of experimental and computational approaches to suggest possible models of how the structural transition of SAHS proteins might occur to protect biological structures. Based on CD analysis, the SAHS proteins appear to undergo a shift from a primarily beta-sheet structure to an alpha-helical structure in increasing TFE concentrations (thought to be desiccation-mimicking conditions), and a 1 μs molecular dynamic simulation showed that short alpha-helices can transiently form upon denaturation of proteins. After the conversion from a globular conformation, the SAHS proteins may form higher-order, gel-like structures that stabilize membrane-bound elements of cells, which may constitute rampart-like “special extracellular structure (SES)” observed outside of the secretory cell membranes of dried tardigrade 28 ."

The biology of tardigrade disordered proteins in extreme stress tolerance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11930778/,"Abstract Anhydrobiosis, a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state, is a remarkable example of survival strategies. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in Ramazzottius varieornatus . These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ significantly in their amino acid sequences. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress.","When exposed to hyperosmotic medium supplemented with 0.5 M sorbitol or 0.2 M NaCl, these CAHS proteins formed different aggregation patterns; CAHS1-mEGFP mainly forms granules and filamentous structures and slightly accumulates at the plasma membrane ( Fig. CAHS1 expression renders HeLa cells resistant to hyperosmotic stress Recent studies have elucidated that the CAHS3 protein forms fibrillar aggregates under hyperosmotic conditions in mammalian cells, thereby enhancing their tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, as observed in Drosophila S2 cells ( Tanaka et al. Although the p -value ( p = 0.058 for CAHS1 compared with mEGFP) indicated that the observed difference was not statistically significant, the data suggest a potential trend toward increased resistance to osmotic stress through CAHS1 expression, which may warrant further investigation."
Production of reactive oxygen species and involvement of bioprotectants during anhydrobiosis in the tardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8816950/,"Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. spatialis was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance.","Previous reports evaluated the oxidative stress associated with desiccation in tardigrades indirectly, by assessing the antioxidant defences mounted in response to drying in whole animals 22 , 46 , or by evaluating the ROS-damaged proteins that can accumulate as carbonylated products during the anhydrobiotic period 60 . spatialis resulted in a significant lower percentage of tardigrades with motility (i.e. lower survival) at every time after the rehydration process with respect to control animals kept hydrated and metabolically active (Controls 1 and 2) and with respect to animals targeted for tps (non-effective gene, Control 3). Similarly, in the larvae of the goldenrod gall fly Eurosta solidaginis, the AQP3 protein which allows water and glycerol to cross the cell membrane is upregulated following desiccation, indicating that the larva is preparing itself for the osmotic stress associated with desiccation 83 ."
Partial weight suspension: A novel murine model for investigating adaptation to reduced musculoskeletal loading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774184/,"Abstract We developed a new model of hypodynamic loading to support mice in chronic conditions of partial weight bearing, enabling simulations of reduced gravity environments and related clinical conditions. Ten-week-old female BALB/cByJ mice were supported for 21 days under Mars-analog suspension (38% weight bearing) and compared with age-matched and jacketed (100% weight bearing) controls. Relative to age-matched controls, mice exposed to Mars-analog loading had significantly lower muscle mass (−23% gastrocnemius wet mass, P < 0.0001); trabecular and cortical bone morphology (i.e., trabecular bone volume: −24% at the distal femur, and cortical thickness: −11% at the femoral midshaft, both P < 0.001); and biomechanical properties of the femoral midshaft (i.e., −27% ultimate moment, P < 0.001). Altogether, these data provide strong rationale for use of our new model of partial weight bearing to further explore the musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments.","As noted, jacketed but fully weight-bearing mice experienced an unexpected increase in body mass, showing significantly higher weight gain in the second and third weeks of the study compared with either age-matched or Mars-analog animals. While we believe the predominant effects of PWS are due to differences in weight bearing, a few observations (i.e., femoral biomechanics and tibial histology) taken at the end of the experiment showing differences between jacketed, fully weight-bearing mice and age-matched controls suggest that the musculoskeletal response may have been influenced by the experimental conditions themselves. In particular, the addition of a tail-suspension control to future studies of partial weight bearing will enable researchers to better explore the potentially osteoprotective effects of partial weight bearing in contrast to full unloading and the role of fluid shift in these changes."
"Partial reductions in mechanical loading yield proportional changes in bone density, bone architecture, and muscle mass",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118556/,"We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb.","This is consistent with Lanyon’s hypothesis of bone adaptation ( 23 , 24 ) and is supported by a recent study in which sciatic neurectomized mice received axial loading to different peak loads and resultant bone mass/strength measures were linearly related to peak load, with no evidence of a lazy zone. Using this tunable model we were able to thoroughly describe bone and muscle adaptation for loading magnitudes in the spectrum between total unloading and normal mechanical loading for the first time, and found that even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. The PWB model will be useful for future studies investigating the specific local mechanical signals, systemic hormones, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to disuse-induced bone loss and muscle atrophy."
Spaceflight and hind limb unloading induce similar changes in electrical impedance characteristics of mouse gastrocnemius muscle,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653813/,"Abstract Objective To assess the potential of electrical impedance myography (EIM) to serve as a marker of muscle fiber atrophy and secondarily as an indicator of bone deterioration by assessing the effects of spaceflight or hind limb unloading. Methods In the first experiment, 6 mice were flown aboard the space shuttle (STS-135) for 13 days and 8 earthbound mice served as controls. Results Reductions in the multifrequency phase-slope parameter were observed for both the space flight and HLU cohorts compared to their respective controls. Conclusions These data support the concept that EIM may serve as a useful tool for assessment of muscle disuse secondary to immobilization or microgravity.","These results support the hypothesis that significant alterations in the electrical impedance of mouse muscle occur after exposure to both spaceflight and hind limb unloading, consistent with our earlier in vivo observations seen in humans following disuse due to casting 16 and rats undergoing hind limb unloading 17 . The resulting voltages from such complex circuits are typically very sensitive to current frequency and thus even subtle alterations in the structure and composition of the tissue are likely to be observed as shifts in the phase-slope measurement. Since muscle contractions provide much of the mechanical loading experienced by bone, and prior studies have shown associations between muscle mass and aBMD 28 , it is perhaps not surprising that calf muscle EIM measurements correlate with leg aBMD."
Spaceflight Activates Lipotoxic Pathways in Mouse Liver,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6915713/,"However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months.","The current investigation demonstrates fluctuations in the temporal patterns of biochemical signal transduction pathways caused by microgravity in three distinct spaceflight datasets (RR1-NASA, RR1-CASIS and RR3) involving RNA-seq and proteomics data analysis compared to microarray data from STS-135. Interestingly, in this work, mutating the gene Clock was sufficient to block tumor onset, implicating again circadian rhythm in radiation-induced liver carcinogenesis, and thus suggesting that the combination of space environment and disrupted sleep may work synergistically in enhancing liver disease, potentially including cancer. We suspect that activation of these pathways will persist during longer duration spaceflight missions, will be exacerbated by disrupted sleep resulting in gradual deposition of lipids in the liver and increased risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and irreversible liver fibrosis."
Treatment with a soluble bone morphogenetic protein type 1A receptor (BMPR1A) fusion protein increases bone mass and bone formation in mice subjected to hindlimb unloading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124165/,"In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment for 3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups compared to comparable VEH‐treated counterparts ( p < 0.05). Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFc led to significantly greater mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold higher bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated CON and HLU animals versus VEH groups, respectively. Altogether, these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse‐induced bone loss.","The increases in BMD, bone microarchitecture, and bone formation rate, and decreases in osteoclast surface seen in the mBMPR1A‐mFC‐treated animals were consistent with those previously reported by Baud'huin and colleagues 8 in normal and ovariectomized mice. We showed that the negative effects of unloading were reversed by inhibition of BMP2/4 signaling via treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein, which led to increased bone mass and improved bone microarchitecture by increased bone formation rate and decreased osteoclast surface. Future dose‐ranging studies with additional time points would be helpful in defining the mechanisms that are responsible for the skeletal responses to mBMPR1A‐mFc. These limitations notwithstanding, these results suggest that inhibiting signaling through the endogenous BMPR1A receptor by treatment with a soluble mBMPR1A‐mFc may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse osteoporosis as it increases bone formation and reduces bone resorption."
RNAseq and RNA molecular barcoding reveal differential gene expression in cortical bone following hindlimb unloading in female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8509868/,"Abstract Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.","Second, while we carefully removed bone marrow, surrounding soft tissues, and both ends of bone, the cortical bone lining cells may have contributed to heterogeneity of cell population, leading to blunted effects on several signaling pathways known to be altered by hindlimb unloading in osteocytes or osteoblasts. However, our ability to identify novel genes that may initiate osteogenic responses later, not previously associated with disuse-induced bone loss provides rationale for future studies with multiple timepoints to expand upon the current findings. Future mechanistic studies examining the functional role of metabolic genes revealed from our study may identify novel mechanosensitive pathways responsible for microgravity- and disuse-induced bone loss."
Proteomic and phosphoproteomic characterization of cardiovascular tissues after long term exposure to simulated space radiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063234/,"Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR 5-ion ) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation. Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation. Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR 5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.","MUP20 is a male pheromone which promotes aggressive male behavior, stimulates female sexual attraction to male urinary scent, promotes a strong learned attraction to the airborne urinary odor of an individual male, and promotes spatial learning by rapidly conditioning preference for its remembered location among females and competitor males so that animals prefer to spend time in the site even when scent is absent ( Roberts et al., 2010 ; Roberts et al., 2010 ; Demir et al., 2020 ). While this finding may not be translatable since humans are the only placental mammals found not to have any active MUP genes ( Logan et al., 2008 ), the finding of MUP20 dysregulation in male mice exposed to GCR 5-ion may illuminate behavioral and learning changes following exposures of rodents to various GCR components. Thus, there is a pressing need for another study that collects samples shortly after GCR exposure to accurately determine what triggers NETs. While the exact mechanism behind NET formation following GCR exposure remains elusive in our study and whether NET formation may have played a role in the astronaut’s development of VTE is unknown, we propose a hypothesis involving chronic tissue damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activation post-radiation exposure as potential mechanisms, warranting further investigation."
Adaptive Changes in the Vestibular System of Land Snail to a 30-Day Spaceflight and Readaptation on Return to Earth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5672023/,"If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored.","Although some afferents remained hypersensitive, the population as a whole recovered within 24–36 h comparable to readaptation time of snail sensory cells and experienced astronauts, and a bit shorter than a 2–3 day space motion sickness period reported in astronauts during 1G readaptation following 6-month manned missions (Heer and Paloski, 2006 ). Directionality of response and single unit analysis Previously we reported (Balaban et al., 2011 ) that the differential sensitivity of statocyst responses to stimuli of different directions (c1 > c2, c3, c4) seen in control snails was lost in the Foton-M3 postflight snails, and we hypothesized a weakening of directional selectivity might occur immediately after spaceflight. Marine mollusks require a fast and reliable recognition of spatial orientation from variable external cues to maintain proper balance and 3D navigation in the sea, and thus their statocyst is the most studied among invertebrates (Wood and Von Baumgarten, 1972 ; Alkon, 1975 ; Janse, 1983 ; Budelmann and Williamson, 1994 ; Deliagina et al., 1998 )."
"Morphology of the Utricular Otolith Organ in the Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899691/,"Abstract The utricle provides the vestibular reflex pathways with the sensory codes of inertial acceleration of self motion and head orientation with respect to gravity to control balance and equilibrium. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7–13 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.","For even relatively short exposures of 12–16 days in a near weightlessness environment aboard the shuttle orbiters (STS-90 and −95) the vestibular nerve afferents supplying the utricle of the toadfish underwent an enormous adjustment of their response sensitivity to an adequate inertial acceleration as revealed by physiological tests using controlled translational acceleration and change in orientation with respect to gravity (tilt/roll) conducted upon return to Earth ( Boyle et al. Further, within the flat, more 2-D, regions of the macula the calculated response patterns of the two sublayers of the otolith membrane, modeled by others ( Grant & Cotton, 1990 ; Grant et al., 1994 ; Kondrachuk, 2002 ), adequately described the movement characteristics of the gel layer for head tilts, and thus viscous forces from the endolymph there likely play a minor role in otolith mechanics during normal head movements. Although we have only one example due to the extremely time-consuming effort of serially reconstructing hair cells at the transmission electron microscopic level to fully characterize their synaptic body content (> 6 months to complete), the finding was particularly revealing: of the 12 hair cells serially reconstructed, all the synaptic bodies within 11 of them were associated with the labeled afferent, and the lone exception was a hair cell that provided half (5/10) of its synaptic bodies to the labeled afferent and the other half (5/10) to an unidentified branch."
"Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,"We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau , in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages.","Vestibular afferents, both semicircular canal (frog: Honrubia et al., 1989 ; toadfish: Boyle and Highstein, 1990a ; Boyle et al., 1991 ; bird: Landolt and Correia, 1980 ; chinchilla: Baird et al., 1988 ; cat: Anderson et al., 1978 ; squirrel monkey: Fernández and Goldberg, 1971 ; rhesus monkey: Schneider et al., 2015 ) and otolith fibers (cat: Loe et al., 1973 ; pigeon: Si et al., 1997 ; primates: Fernández and Goldberg, 1976a , b , c ; Angelaki and Dickman, 2000 ; Jamali et al., 2009 ; Yu et al., 2012 ) differ from one another in their discharge patterns and response properties to adequate stimuli. For example, axons presumed to originate from efferent neurons were too infrequently encountered and their discharge had no clear variants to permit a meaningful comparison among subjects within or across groups, and the EVS action on afferent sensitivity to acceleration stimuli via its influence on hair cell receptor potential could not be normalized in any meaningful manner, mostly due to the variability in EVS efficacy and frequency of occurrence within each fish. Although in a classical sense the EVS might still provide an underlying tonic drive to its targets, for the sake of argument in the present context a drive that also monitors the prevailing gravity condition, it does not provide cross-talk between otoliths and canals for continuous passive stimuli or influence the output during benign and nonthreatening volitional movements."
Organization of the ER-Golgi interface for membrane traffic control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4064004/,"While these core coat machineries and other transport factors are highly conserved across species, high-resolution imaging studies indicate that the organization of the ER–Golgi interface is varied in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of COPII assembly, in some cases to manage distinct cellular cargo, is emerging as one important component in determining this structure. Comparison of the ER–Golgi interface across different systems, particularly mammalian and plant cells, reveals fundamental elements and distinct organization of this interface. A better understanding of how these interfaces are regulated to meet varying cellular secretory demands should provide key insights into the mechanisms that control efficient trafficking of proteins and lipids through the secretory pathway.","But studying how the UPR orchestrates such adaptation may be challenging because there are multiple branches of the UPR in animal and plant cells 53 , 111 , and these are likely to work in concert with several other signalling networks that regulate membrane traffic. Advancing such ‘systems-level’ questions will depend on the identification of all required factors, in vivo microscopy and cell-free assays to accurately measure cargo biosynthetic and transport rates, as well as the elucidation of the sensor networks that are in place for overall coordination of distinct trafficking steps. Continued comparative analyses across a range of model organisms should ultimately allow us to further define the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of ER–Golgi transport in the context of cellular function."
IRE1: ER stress sensor and cell fate executor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3818365/,"Abstract Cells operate a signaling network termed unfolded protein response (UPR) to monitor protein-folding capacity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

Interestingly, although mammalian IRE1α is essential for UPR in goblet cells, in other cell types, there is no detectable defect in UPR target gene induction in a mammalian ire1 double mutant likely due to partially overlapping function with ATF6 and PERK [ 46 , 58 ]. Although it is unclear whether plant IRE1 senses signaling beyond protein-folding capacity, an Arabidopsis ire1 double mutant displaying a root-specific phenotype under unstressed conditions hints that plant IRE1 also integrates physiological signals to maintain specific secretory activity [ 17 ]; however, this hypothesis is still awaiting experimental validation. Moreover, with the ease of building high order plant mutants, in vivo phenotypic analyses show that Arabidopsis IRE1 and a conserved component of the G protein complex display a synergistic effect in both plant UPR activation and growth regulation."
Inter-regulation of the unfolded protein response and auxin signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3981873/,"SUMMARY The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling network triggered by overload of protein-folding demand in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition termed ER stress. The UPR is critical for growth and development; nonetheless, connections between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes remain largely unknown. Furthermore, by establishing that UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin transporters, including PIN5, we define a long-neglected biological significance of ER-based auxin regulation. Our results imply that the plant UPR has evolved a hormone-dependent strategy for coordinating ER function with physiological processes.","The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling network triggered by overload of protein-folding demand in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition termed ER stress.

"Unfolded protein response in plants: one master, many questions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4618186/,"Abstract To overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ER-localized stress sensors actuate distinct downstream organelle-nucleus signaling pathways to invoke a cytoprotective response, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to yeast and metazoans, plant UPR studies are more recent but nevertheless fascinating. Here we discuss recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlight conserved and unique features of the plant UPR as well as critical yet-open questions whose answers will likely make significant contributions to the understanding plant ER stress management.","Understanding the mechanisms of the plant UPR is important to define conserved and unique strategies for ER stress responses, and it offers exciting perspectives to improve plant productivity. While we are beginning to understand how the UPR intersects with hormone-regulated growth [ 37•• , 38 ], defense [ 5 , 24 , 39 ], and resistance to hostile environments [ 4 , 40 ], further insights into the temporal and spatial complexity of the UPR regulation will support biotechnological applications. Exploration of plant ER-stress responses in the field using multiple species and ecotypes adapted to different environmental conditions could provide further insights into the design of novel strategies for plant ER stress management outside standard laboratory conditions."
Vesicles versus Tubes: Is Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi Transport in Plants Fundamentally Different from Other Eukaryotes?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4453782/,Four leading cell biologists reflect on the controversial nature of the vector for transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus in higher plants.,"On the other hand, new techniques such as SCLIM are emerging that have the potential for even higher superresolution not only in space, but also in time and may well bring about a breakthrough in understanding what really is going on in living cells. Thus, perhaps a combination of ultra-rapid freezing and freeze substitution combined with selective membrane staining and one of the new high-resolution three-dimensional scanning electron microscopy technologies such as focussed ion beam-scanning electron microscopy or serial block face imaging might solve some of the mysteries of the plant ER -Golgi interface and help settle the controversy explored in this article. While it seems that the situation in tobacco BY2 cells is not too different from that of leaf epidermal cells, there are other cell types such as in the meristem or in the endosperm during cellularization whose secretion status is unclear and where it is difficult, especially by conventional live-cell imaging, to recognize a close spatial relationship between the ER and Golgi stacks, let alone being able to say anything about Golgi motility due to the sheer density of the cytoplasm."
Pectin methylesterification impacts the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4902601/,"High levels of methylesterification of pectin allow for enhanced cell expansion, partitioning of resources to leaf growth, and increased leaf area for photosynthesis, which in turn enhance plant growth.","Based on the model that reduced methylation of pectin may enhance Ca 2+ -mediated cross linking of GalUA in cell walls, thereby preventing normal cell expansion in cgr2/3 ( Burton et al., 2000 ; Wolf et al., 2009 ; Kim et al., 2015 ), we propose that the larger number of smaller mesophyll cells observed in cgr2/3 during this study is likely linked to the hardening of the cell wall and consequent restriction of cell wall expansion. CGR2 and CGR3 Affect Area-Based Respiration and Daily C Gain by Altering LMD and LMA In general, leaves growing under high light develop thicker leaves with multiple cell layers and higher LMA (lower SLA ), and incurs higher area-based respiration rates corresponding to their greater mass per unit leaf area ( Mitchell et al., 1999 ; Lambers et al., 2008 ). Therefore, photosynthesis drives plant growth through alterations in C partitioning to new leaf area growth and LMA growth, and this study discovered that pectin methylesterification affects this relationship by directly altering the degree of cell expansion and positioning in the leaves to create dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass thereby driving C partitioning for these processes."
Reduced Chloroplast Coverage genes from Arabidopsis thaliana help to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4776492/,"Significance Mechanisms that determine the cellular volume allocated to organelles are largely unknown. We demonstrate that in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana , a small gene family that encodes proteins of unknown function contributes to a mechanism that establishes the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts. We show that this mechanism resides outside of the chloroplast by demonstrating that the protein that makes the greatest contribution to this mechanism resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus and that the trafficking of this protein between the cytoplasm and nucleus may regulate this mechanism. A deeper understanding of this mechanism may lead to the rational manipulation of chloroplast compartment size, which may lead to more efficient photosynthesis and increased yields from important crop plants.","Our finding that inducing an increase in the levels of chlorophyll does not affect chloroplast coverage in rec1-3 rec2 rec3-1 friendly and that chloroplast coverage is not significantly different from wild type in the chlorophyll-deficient mutants cch , gun4-1 , cop1-4 , det1-1 , and phyA phyB indicates that chlorophyll deficiencies do not prevent chloroplasts from keeping pace with the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment. Additionally, a screen of 5,200 Arabidopsis mutants that were homozygous for T-DNA insertions in nuclear genes that mostly encode chloroplast proteins for mutants with aberrant morphologies in the chloroplast compartment, such as abnormal chloroplast coverage, yielded one chloroplast division mutant and no chloroplast coverage mutants ( 46 ). The enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence, chloroplasts aligning along the anticlinal walls, abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure, and chlorophyll deficiencies in the rec and friendly mutants indicate that these mutant alleles induce chloroplast dysfunction."
Maintaining the factory: The roles of the unfolded protein response in cellular homeostasis in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5415411/,"Summary Much like a factory, the endoplasmic reticulum assembles simple cellular building blocks into complex molecular machines known as proteins. In order to protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. As such, plants make special use of the UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect organism growth and development as well as stress responses. In this review we outline recent developments in this field that support a strong relevance of the UPR to many areas of plant life.","Much like a factory, the endoplasmic reticulum assembles simple cellular building blocks into complex molecular machines known as proteins.

NADPH oxidase activity is required for ER stress survival in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289879/,"Abstract In all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. These results ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes.","Homeostasis of NADPH Oxidase activity is required to maintain an effective UPR Several studies, including studies of RBOH activity during heat stress response in plants, support a non-specific “transcriptional priming” by which fast acting ROS production by RBOHD amplifies initial stress-specific transcriptional responses in local and systemic tissues ( Mittler et al. The ROS species produced by RBOHD and RBOHF suppress the spread of runaway cell death in a pathway parallel to the Lesion Stimulating Disease 1 (LSD1) zinc-finger protein under normal growth conditions, in response to salicylic acid, extracellular superoxide, and pathogen induced hypersensitive response ( Torres et al. Under this light, the noted misregulation of RBOH activity and accumulation of H 2 O 2 in ire1a ire1b and bzip60 bzip28 mutants during ER stress (Figures 2E , 3C ) may represent convergent signals that initiate processes leading toward programmed cell death, and could at least partially explain the hypersensitivity of these lines to ER stress conditions ( Figure 4 – 6 ) ( Chen et al."
Relevance of the Unfolded Protein Response to Spaceflight-Induced Transcriptional Reprogramming in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7987364/,"Abstract Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling in wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.","However, some broad biological pathways have been found to be induced or repressed in response to spaceflight, including cell wall modification, response to light/high light, oxidative stress, osmotic stress response, heat shock, and biotic defense/secondary metabolite synthesis (Paul et al. However, upon closer analysis of the underlying FPKM values, it became clear that the differences in fold change values (flight/ground) across genotypes were more heavily influenced by the differential regulation of expression in the ground samples by the UPR regulators ( Fig. Independent of the underlying stimulus for the observed differences, the possibility that bZIP60 and bZIP28 may have antagonistic interactions related to control of abscisic acid signaling or water deprivation responses should be investigated at the molecular level in the future to improve plant growth and stress responses in space and on the ground."

Genomic stability in response to high versus low linear energy transfer radiation in Arabidopsis thaliana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033213/,"Abstract Low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and high LET HZE (high atomic weight, high energy) particles act as powerful mutagens in both plants and animals. To understand the genetic requirements for resistance to high versus low LET radiation, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were exposed to either 1GeV Fe nuclei or gamma radiation. A comparison of effects on the germination and subsequent growth of seedlings led us to conclude that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the two types of radiation (HZE versus gamma) are roughly 3:1. The “replication fork” checkpoint, governed by ATR, played a slightly more important role in resistance to HZE-induced mutagenesis than in resistance to gamma induced mutagenesis.","Loss of the wt allele marker in a heterozygous single cell, whether as a result of anueploidy, loss of the distal portion of the chromosome, or mutation of the wild-type allele, followed by production of mutant cell files via cell division, results in the production of an albino sector ( Figure 2 , inset) The frequency with which these sectors occur within a population provides a measure of genomic stability ( Yoshiyama et al., 2009 ). LINES DEFECTIVE IN DNA DSB REPAIR EXHIBIT A DECREASE IN GENOMIC STABILITY Given the significant roles LIG4 and the KU70/KU80 heterodimer play in NHEJ ( Friesner and Britt, 2003 ), we sought to determine the importance of these factors in maintaining genomic stability during the repair of IR-induced DSBs. As in the case of wild-type, at low doses, our lig4 and ku80 lines exhibited a roughly linear increase in the frequency of sectoring with exposure to increased levels of radiation; however, unlike our wild-type line, a significant drop-off in sectoring was observed at higher doses of either HZE or gamma radiation ( Figure 3 ). In light of the fact that ATM is thought to respond directly to DSBs via interaction with proteins associated with the breaks ( Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003 ; Lee and Paull, 2005 ), whereas ATR is thought to respond to the presence of persistent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ( Burrows and Elledge, 2008 ; Cimprich and Cortez, 2008 ), we were interested in whether ATM and ATR function differently in maintaining genomic stability in response to the damage caused by HZE versus gamma radiation."
Acceleration profiles and processing methods for parabolic flight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6081456/,"Abstract Parabolic flights provide cost-effective, time-limited access to “weightless” or reduced gravity conditions, facilitating research and validation activities that complement infrequent and costly access to space. Here we present a solution for collecting, analyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during parabolic flights, which we validated during a Boeing 727-200F flight with 20 parabolas. Our solution can be integrated with diverse experimental designs, does not depend upon accelerometer orientation, and allows unsupervised classification of all phases of flight, providing a consistent and open-source approach to quantifying gravito-inertial accelerations (GIA), or g levels. As academic, governmental, and commercial use of space advances, data availability and validated processing methods will enable better planning, execution, and analysis of parabolic flight experiments, and thus facilitate future space activities.","9 Although considerable effort was dedicated to identifying the highest quality, low g time periods (with variations less than ± 0.01 g ) from these flights, neither the acquisition hardware, the raw data, nor the code implemented for analysis, are currently available to the public. Here, we provide the following: (1) a commercially available hardware solution for data acquisition; (2) raw and calibrated data for all phases of flight; (3) data analysis methodology that is independent of accelerometer orientation, and (4) characterization of g levels and durations achieved for 20 parabolas. We encourage future parabolic flight experimenters to release raw data as well as to provide data processing details (ideally including in executable form) to facilitate validation and improvement of processing algorithms, as well as refine expected g levels and support planning and analysis that can be tailored to specific experimenter needs."
Cytoskeleton structure and total methylation of mouse cardiac and lung tissue during space flight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955502/,"Abstract The purpose of this work was to evaluate the protein and mRNA expression levels of multiple cytoskeletal proteins in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice that were euthanized onboard the United States Orbital Segment of the International Space Station 37 days after the start of the SpaceX-4 mission (September 2014, USA). The results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the cardiac and lung tissue of the mice, but there were significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase in total genome methylation. The mRNA expression levels of DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase did not change, and the mRNA expression level of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased.","Long duration microgravity does not lead to notable changes in cytoskeletal protein contents in the cardiac and lung tissue The relative contents of beta-actin, gamma-actin, beta-tubulin and desmin both in membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of the cardiac tissue remained at the same level in all the study groups. Earlier, we proposed a model wherein changes of the external mechanical load can lead to the dissociation of actin-binding proteins from the cortical cytoskeleton and the triggering signaling pathways, leading to a change in the expression level of the corresponding genes, which in turn leads to a redistribution of cytoskeletal proteins between the cellular compartments [ 38 ]. [ 32 ] found that several genes encoding the various putative DNA methyltransferases, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases, the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler (DDM1) and siRNA-related proteins are extremely sensitive to perturbation by space flight, which may be an underlying cause for the altered methylation patterns in plants subjected to space flight."
Toward countering muscle and bone loss with spaceflight: GSK3 as a potential target,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10285634/,"Summary We examined the effects of ∼30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, rodent research [RR]1, RR9, and RR18).

Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,"We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca 2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment.","[Conclusion Not Found; Full Article Summary]: © The Author(s) 2024 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE, also seen as BMX-001), an antioxidant that acts as a SOD mimetic 28 , 29 , could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction in the murine soleus muscle following 35 days of spaceflight. 78 treated rats with the SERCA activator, CDN1163, during hindlimb suspension (NASA’s simulated model of microgravity) and, while they didn’t measure SERCA function directly, they found improvements in several muscle parameters including soleus fatigue resistance, mitochondrial markers, and markers of Ca 2+ homeostasis. Western blotting Western blotting was performed on muscle homogenate to assess protein content for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, total and phosphorylated content of the Ca 2+ release protein ryanodine receptor (RYR1/2), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) as a marker of oxidative stress, SOD, and the three SERCA regulators, sarcolipin (SLN), neuronatin (NNAT), and phospholamban (PLN) as previously described 5 , 19 .

Cardiovascular progenitor cells cultured aboard the International Space Station exhibit altered developmental and functional properties,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062551/,"Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction ( YAP1, RHOA ) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes ( VIM , NES , DES , LMNB2 , LMNA ), non-canonical Wnt ligands ( WNT5A , WNT9A ), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules ( PLCG1 , PRKCA ) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers ( TNNT2 , VWF , and RUNX2 ), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.","However, since KEGG analysis only identifies broad categories of genes (i.e., functional categories) that are likely targets of the microRNAs under study, further experiments are warranted to identify the cumulative impact of these microRNAs on signaling in space-flown CPCs. These results motivated us to assess the overall impact of spaceflight on YAP1 , an effector of Hippo signaling that functions with TAZ to regulate transcription. 21 Similarly, the decreased expression of YAP1 and RUNX2 observed in this experiment indicate that spaceflight reduces mechanotransduction in neonatal CPCs. In addition to broadly targeting the Hippo signaling pathway and ECM interactions, select microRNAs that were modified by culture aboard the ISS are known to be critically involved in cardiac development. Interestingly, the age-dependent changes in developmental status following culture aboard the ISS suggest fundamental differences in adult CPCs. While KEGG analysis demonstrated that functionally similar pathways are likely affected in both adult and neonatal CPCs, only the latter population experienced significant changes to the expression of cytoskeletal genes and early developmental markers."
Inter-agency perspective: Translating advances in biomarker discovery and medical countermeasures development between terrestrial and space radiation environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9832585/,"Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet undeniably similar human populations – cancer patients, public citizens, and astronauts.","There are several terrestrial-based radiation injury prevention products, either in routine clinical use or undergoing testing through other U.S. government programs such as NCI and NIAID, that could be used to address the health needs of humans in space and vice versa. Looking to the future, commercial space tourism is already a reality for sub-orbital flights and low-earth orbits, with private astronaut missions to the International Space Station currently underway, and moon trips expected during the next few decades. Continued collaboration between organizations tasked with developing approaches to address radiation-induced injuries will ensure that products with the greatest promise are studied across all agencies’ mission-specific requirements and that human health will be well-addressed by NASA for their future long-term space flights."
Genomic and functional characterization of Enterococcus faecalis isolates recovered from the International Space Station and their potential for pathogenicity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7829349/,"Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms.","While multiple studies have detected the presence of a wide range of opportunistic human pathogens onboard the ISS, the consensus was that additional data was needed to determine if these microorganisms posed an actual threat to crew health ( Schiwon et al., 2013 ; Be et al., 2017 ; Lang et al., 2017 ; Singh et al., 2018a , b ; Mora et al., 2019 ; Sielaff et al., 2019 , Sobisch et al., 2019 ; Urbaniak et al., 2019 ). The MinION is currently capable of identifying bacterial species in near real time from metagenomic data ( Sanderson et al., 2018 ) or isolated samples ( Gargis et al., 2019 ) and has been used for the first ever off-Earth identification of bacteria cultured and sequenced in flight ( Burton et al., 2020 ). Then, any isolates exhibiting HLGR should be sequenced using the MinION and evaluated for the presence of the type 2 capsule ( McBride et al., 2007 ), the vancomycin resistance operon observed in V583 ( Paulsen et al., 2003 ), components of the pathogenicity island ( e.g ., cytolysin production loci and the enterococcal surface protein, Esp), and the absence of functional CRISPR-Cas arrays ( Van Tyne et al., 2019 )."
Evaluation of in vitro macrophage differentiation during space flight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570223/,"Abstract We differentiated mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony stimulating (rM-CSF) factor for 14 days during the flight of space shuttle Space Transportation System (STS)-126. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. These data confirm that a space flight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells.","Moreover, when we assessed the relative levels of transcripts of transcription factors (Sfpi1, Egr1, Myc, Stat3, Tnf, Hoxb7, Cebpb, Runx1, Chrac1, Egr1, Irf1, Jun, and Fos ) that are necessary for the differentiation of M-CFU into macrophages ( Valledor et al., 1998 ), we found that most of these were not significantly up or down regulated (>1.5 fold) in the space-flight samples compared to ground controls. In contrast, two of the three transcription factors that are significantly down regulated during early macrophage differentiation in space flight samples ( Gata2 and Runx1 ) are either not needed for macrophage terminal differentiation ( Gata2 ) ( Tsai and Orkin, 1997 ) or serve as an inhibitor of proliferation ( Runx1 ) ( Himes et al., 2005 ). For example, fragments of plasminogen (encoded by Plg ), which had significantly lower transcript concentrations in flight samples compared to ground controls, inhibit angiogenesis ( O’Reilly et al., 1994 ) and are involved in regulating macrophage migration ( Gong et al., 2008 )."
Identification of critical host mitochondrion-associated genes during Ehrlichia chaffeensis infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3457586/,"To determine what host components are important for bacterial replication, we performed microarray analysis on Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells by comparing host gene transcript levels between permissive and nonpermissive conditions for E.

Analysis of RNA by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that the bacterial load was decreased in these mutant flies compared to wild-type infected control flies. Treatment of THP-1 cells with double-stranded RNA to silence the human UCK2 gene indicates that the disruption of the uridine-cytidine kinase affects E.","Cht11 is orthologous to the Chitinase 11 gene of Tribolium castaneum , which has been assigned to a separate classification group (group VII) from other identified chitinases ( 3 ) (Subbaratnam Muthukrishnan, Kansas State University, personal communication). Indeed, the STRING association tool ( 60 ) shows that CCDC58 has a direct relationship with mitochondrial ribosomal protein S28 ( MRPS28 ) and translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 9 homolog ( TIMM9 ), which encode an inner mitochondrial membrane chaperone protein, SSBP1, a protein putatively thought to be involved in mitochondrial DNA replication ( 60 ). The BioGraph gene association tool ( 33 ) assigned a rank of 23 out of 18,180 gene concepts (top 0.13%) when it was assigned to “mitochondria.” Other coiled-coil domain-containing proteins have been associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane ( 70 ), and CCDC58 has also been associated with the mitochondrial single-nucleotide polymorphisms that impact the progression of AIDS ( 26 )."
Ehrlichia chaffeensis replication sites in adult Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3558598/,"Abstract Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium which causes the tick-borne disease human monocytic ehrlichiosis.

In general, when one looks at the bacteria growth kinetics in tissues that are not affected by Uck2 or san knockdown (eyes, wings, salivary glands), bacterial numbers generally increase over time after infection ( Fig. However, when Uck2 or san genes were silenced specifically in the fat body, the bacteria growth kinetics showed an initial increase in bacterial numbers for 24 h that paralleled the growth of the bacteria in the parental (non-RNAi control) fly lines ( Fig."
Development and characterization of two porcine monocyte-derived macrophage cell lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11046949/,"Virus yield reduction, virucidal, and cell cytotoxicity experiments were performed on positive hits and two lead compounds were further characterized in dose-dependent assays along with time-of-addition, time-of-removal, virus entry, and viral protein synthesis assays. The antiviral effects of the two lead compounds on mitigating virulent ASFV infection in porcine macrophages (PAMs) were also tested using similar methods, and the ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production during virulent ASFV infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The screen identified five compounds that inhibited ASFV-induced CPE by greater than 50% and virus yield reduction experiments showed that two of these compounds, tetrandrine and berbamine, exhibited particularly high levels of anti-ASFV activity. Conclusions Together, these findings support that dual-acting natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties hold promise as preventative and therapeutic agents to combat ASFV infection by simultaneously inhibiting viral replication and reducing virus-induced cytokine production.","In this work, the screening of a library of natural compounds with anti-inflammatory properties led to the identification of five promising candidates—paeonol, pinoresinol, curcumin, berbamine, and tetrandrine—that showed substantial inhibition of ASFV-induced CPE without affecting cell monolayers. In the present context, further mechanistic investigations focused on berbamine and tetrandrine revealed their dose-dependent antiviral activities, inhibiting the synthesis of ASFV proteins and consistently reducing viral yields across different MOIs. Time-of-addition experiments elucidated the compounds’ action points within the viral replication cycle, highlighting their significant impact during pre- and co-treatment phases. These findings are particularly significant because berbamine and tetrandrine, along with other bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, have also been recently reported to inhibit porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) with similar potency [ 40 , 41 ], suggesting their broad utility as porcine virus countermeasures."
Understanding macrophage differentiation during space flight: The importance of ground-based experiments before space flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890248/,"Abstract In preparation for a space flight on STS-126, two in vitro culture systems were used to investigate macrophage colony stimulating factor-dependent macrophage differentiation from mouse primary bone marrow cells.

Bone marrow leptin signaling mediates obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation in male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3868799/,"We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient ( db / db ) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine.","Moreover, leptin signaling deficiency in HFD-fed WT mice reconstituted with leptin receptor-null bone marrow resulted in greater than 2-fold reduction in the expression transcript levels for Il6 and Ccl2 in gonadal fat and almost 2-fold for Tnfa ( Table 1 ), indicative of a proinflammatory environment.

The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, which in our study was close to 2-fold lower (mRNA) in WT/db AT compared with that of WT/WT mice ( Table 1 ), directly contributes to insulin resistance through suppression of glucose transporter GLUT4 gene expression ( 41 ) and induction of serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 ( 42 )."
Establishment and characterization of DB-1: a leptin receptor-deficient murine macrophage cell line,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4960141/,"To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation.","Indeed, the DB-1 cells have many of the characteristics of ex vivo bone marrow-derived macrophages, thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal WT and primary leptin receptor-deficient macrophages, which the DB-1 cells are hoped to replace in assays. The lack of the leptin gene ( Lep ) as well as Lepr have been associated with an enhanced susceptibility to infections and a higher mortality rate in rodents following bacterial infection (Ikejima et al. The difference in phagocytic activity between our DB-1 macrophages and that of ob/ob and db/db primary macrophages evaluated in other studies might be explained by the fact that we used inert fluorescent beads in our study compared to actual infectious agents (Loffreda et al."
Validation of methods to assess the immunoglobulin gene repertoire in tissues obtained from mice on the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5736159/,"Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after space flight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Igκ variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq datasets and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and produce a data set that provides other data mining options.","We were concerned that tissue isolation methods may introduce artifacts into the data since many studies specifically focus on single cell suspensions; often sorted, to isolate B cells specifically ( Greiff et al., 2014 ; Kaplinsky et al., 2014 ; Kramer et al., 2016 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). By utilizing multiple mapping methods and subsequent selection for the sequence with the most information, we are able to obtain a relatively large number of antibody sequences without introducing primer bias or PCR-induced sequencing errors. In conclusion, our goals for this project were to examine the breadth of the antibody repertoire gathering information about V, D, J, and constant region usage and CDR3 composition and to lay the foundation for future studies that will examine the immune response to vaccination during space flight."
Characterization of the naive murine antibody repertoire using unamplified high-throughput sequencing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5761896/,"We studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. This study presents a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.","Others have looked at Ig-gene segment usage with other strategies [ 26 , 36 , 41 – 43 ] but we wanted to determine if a straight-forward RNA-Seq approach would provide us with a reasonable assessment of B cell Ig-segment use without the limitations that amplification methods introduce (Rettig et al ., In Revision). used primer amplification to enrich for IgH transcripts and still found high CDR3 variability among individuals [ 26 , 36 ].Similarly, in a study comparing monozygotic twins, Glanville et al ., also demonstrated that CDR3 profiles between the individuals were quite diverse despite similar gene family usage between the twins [ 48 ]. If we assume that there are 5 x 10 6 B cells in a nine to eleven-week-old female C57BL/6J mouse spleen, and our mouse pools were made up of four spleens, this estimate of the possible splenic B-cell pool is reasonably accurate, especially if we take into account some of the CDR3 sequences were detected multiple times (multiple B cells with the same IgH)."
Effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5826609/,"The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.","While previous analyses by our lab used splenic mRNA pooled from four animals (Rettig et al., Submitted for Publication in PLOS ONE, ( Rettig et al., 2017 )), the current study assessed individual mice and exhibited significantly more mouse-to-mouse variation than one might expect in inbred mice; even within treatment groups and compared to pooled mouse samples. An assessment of the impact of hypergravity on the similarly assembled T cell receptor repertoire of neonatal mice showed low correlation of individual Beta chain V- and J-gene segment recombination frequencies between control animals and animals subjected to centrifugation. A larger sample size would help solidify this conclusion, but these data provide preliminary suggestions that the recombinatorial processes that lead to the diverse Ig repertoires in mice are not affected by a short trip to and stay on the ISS."
A comparison of unamplified and massively multiplexed PCR amplification for murine antibody repertoire sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366624/,"To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s.","11,200 complete reads), better low frequency CDR3 detection (20-fold more unique CDR3 sequence than the unamplified KSU data set), and sequencing costs can be lower than an Illumina MiSeq run (by integrating multiplexing/barcoding).

Instead, the we used strict read quality cutoffs to prevent low quality base calls from being included in analysis, and we point to our highly overlapping V-gene segment usage (R 2 = 0.9995 among multiple sequencing replicates to assure us that we minimized artifacts."

Effects of skeletal unloading on the bone marrow antibody repertoire of tetanus toxoid and/or CpG treated C57BL/6J mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11929063/,"Abstract This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK-754, an AAV8-based human factor VIII (FVIII) vector designed to deliver a codon-optimized and CpG-depleted B domain-deleted F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific promoter for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A.

An Analysis of the Effects of Spaceflight and Vaccination on Antibody Repertoire Diversity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10996920/,"Abstract Ab repertoire diversity plays a critical role in the host’s ability to fight pathogens. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow.","The CASIS and TARDIS spleen datasets provided us a unique situation to directly compare spaceflight data to the AOS model of microgravity using the same bioinformatics methodology. However, when the complete CASIS dataset was compared with the complete TARDIS dataset, we found that the CASIS animals had significantly lower SIs. Although our total read counts were similar between the two experiments (CASIS, 66,909–181,703; TARDIS average, 82,655–109,107) ( 5 , 6 ), the low number of samples in the CASIS dataset ( n = 6) compared with the TARDIS dataset ( n = 32) is more likely to be skewed by a single low diversity mouse. Alternatively, previous studies have shown that V-gene segment usage by naive B cells in the spleen and pre–B cells in the bone marrow are strongly influenced by the genetic background of the animal, whereas the plasma cells are a mostly individual variation ( 12 )."
Effects of spaceflight aboard the International Space Station on mouse estrous cycle and ovarian gene expression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954810/,"Abstract Ovarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes of most tissues within the body, including muscle, bone, neural, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Contemporary control (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacrifice and similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and flight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile.","While measuring true estrous cyclicity in space is logistically daunting due to the intensive daily monitoring required, we posit that the analysis of the vaginal wall provides a robust methodology that can indicate the estrous stage, and thus the endocrine status of the animal at the moment of sacrifice. Indeed the morphology of these twice frozen and thawed vaginal wall tissues rivaled that of freshly isolated and fixed tissues from contemporary animals collected in our laboratory (data not shown) and in those laboratories who pioneered the use of vaginal wall histology as a mechanism to track cyclicity 20 , 22 , 23 . The current studies also provide critical logistical information regarding tissue collection, particularly for organs such as the ovary and uterus, which are composed of highly dynamic tissues (follicles, corpora lutea, endometrium), we recommend that they be preserved primarily in fixatives or in a manner where tissue/cell specific aspects can be determined afterward."
Effect of spaceflight on Pseudomonas aeruginosa final cell density is modulated by nutrient and oxygen availability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4228280/,"In order to build our understanding of how spaceflight affects bacterial final cell densities, additional studies are needed to determine whether the observed differences are due to varied methods, experimental conditions, or organism specific responses. aeruginosa grown during spaceflight exhibited increased final cell density relative to normal gravity controls when low concentrations of phosphate in the media were combined with decreased oxygen availability. Conclusions These results indicate that differences in bacterial final cell densities observed between spaceflight and normal gravity are due to an interplay between microgravity conditions and the availability of substrates essential for growth. Considering that the majority of bacteria inhabiting spacecrafts and space stations are likely to live under nutrient limitations, our findings highlight the need to explore the impact microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment have on microbial growth and physiology.","Although fixing the cells prevents one from distinguishing between live and dead populations, the effects of post-growth storage at 8°C on cell viability indicate that the viability of cells during post-growth storage should be assessed on Earth prior to spaceflight studies, and suggest that the use of viable cell measurements should be avoided when possible. Interestingly, the observation that Salmonella virulence is increased following growth during spaceflight [ 13 ], which has been confirmed by both additional spaceflight and simulated microgravity experiments [ 15 ], indicates that at least some of the physiological changes that occur during spaceflight are maintained when the samples are returned to Earth and assayed or used immediately. Similar to previous observations that increasing phosphate concentration or supplementing media with the inorganic ion components of M9 media, which includes phosphate, can minimize the effects of spaceflight or LSMMG on virulence and acid tolerance of Salmonella [ 15 ], we observed that increasing the phosphate concentration from 5 to 50 mM in the artificial urine media minimized the differences between spaceflight and normal gravity final cell densities of P."
Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3639165/,"While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.","Under microgravity conditions, the virtual absence of flow and gravity may promote the unlimited expansion of the mushroom “caps” resulting in the formation of the intact canopy on top of the relatively widely spaced columns. We anticipate that these data will lead to the development of mathematical models describing the physico-chemical environment experienced by the cells under microgravity and normal gravity conditions and insights into the nature of the differences that cause the observed changes in growth and dependence on nutrient availability. aeruginosa biofilms formed in microgravity suggests that nature is capable of adapting to non-terrestrial environments in ways that deserve further studies, including those exploring long-term growth and adaptation to a low gravity environment."

GENELAB DATABASE HOLDINGS As of August 2020, GeneLab houses data from 271 studies representing investigations of many kinds of spaceflight experimental factors: gravity level (microgravity, hypergravity), ionizing radiation, circadian disruption, and atmospheric pressure, together with information on confounding variables such as organism diet, age, and sample preservation methods, for a variety of biological organisms (Figure 2 ). For example, the API can be leveraged to interrogate the entirety of the GeneLab database for RNA-Seq assay gene expression counts from all samples from Mus musculus that experienced a specified level of ionizing radiation; such a request returns gene counts from multiple datasets as well as all other metadata values associated with the samples (status of space flight, radiation dose, diet, age, etc.), immediately providing the end-user with data and annotations suitable to build a complex model that accounts for all main and confounding factors known to the database. Furthermore, NASA has developed the GeneLab 4 High School (GL4HS) training program, in which fifteen high school students learn how to use the GeneLab tools over four weeks to analyze spaceflight microarray and RNA-seq data, how to generate follow-on hypotheses based on these analyses, how to design a ground-based experiment to test these hypotheses, and ultimately write research proposals for the experiments ( https://www.nasa.gov/ames/genelab-for-high-schools ). FUTURE DIRECTIONS Astronaut data In 2011 the National Research Council of the U.S. recognized the importance of collecting astronaut data, in addition to model organism data in the Decadal Survey ( 16 ): ‘because of the limited number of humans who undergo exposure to the space environment, maintaining an extensive and well-organized database and managing it as a resource to be shared with the scientific community has long been viewed as an essential step for scientific discovery’."

Knowledge Network Embedding of Transcriptomic Data from Spaceflown Mice Uncovers Signs and Symptoms Associated with Terrestrial Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7828077/,"Abstract There has long been an interest in understanding how the hazards from spaceflight may trigger or exacerbate human diseases. With the goal of advancing our knowledge on physiological changes during space travel, NASA GeneLab provides an open-source repository of multi-omics data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. Alone, this data enables identification of biological changes during spaceflight, but cannot infer how that may impact an astronaut at the phenotypic level. To bridge this gap, Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a heterogeneous knowledge graph connecting biological and clinical data from over 30 databases, was used in combination with GeneLab transcriptomic data from six studies.","Additionally, NASA GeneLab data brought into the SPOKE system could be complemented by including murine phenotypical pathophysiological and biochemical non-omics data (more nodes) from the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive [ 34 ], and eventually the SPOKE system could be used for human spaceflight research data related to astronauts. Thus, expanding the computational approaches from the general comparison of spaceflight and terrestrial diseases to using input from a single subject to map their individual risk profile would allow developing optimal medical care for individual astronauts. Notably, the power of SPOKE stems from a wide variety of its inputs that combine multi-omics, clinical, and physiological data, which may provide a useful complement to the currently utilized risk management tools that are based upon probabilistic mathematical modeling and simulations [ 37 ]."

Spatially resolved multiomics on the neuronal effects induced by spaceflight in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166911/,"In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies. For broader scientific impact, all datasets from this study are available through an interactive data portal, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Open Science Data Repository (OSDR).","The main alterations in gene expression induced by spaceflight included changes in synaptogenesis and neuronal development, as well as neurodegeneration and inflammation, similar to previously reported tissue and behavioral-level effects of simulated spaceflight and simulated deep space radiation in mice 12 . This study applies spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multiomics to study the effects of spaceflight on the CNS which can serve as a stepping stone towards comparative investigation of samples from other space missions and the outcomes of live animal return and reacclimation to Earth conditions. In summary, in this study, we observed that spaceflight altered the expression of genes associated with neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal development in multiple regions of the brain, especially striatum, as well as oxidative stress and neuroinflammation collectively resembling neurological aging and neurodegeneration."

NASA GeneLab derived microarray studies of Mus musculus and Homo sapiens organisms in altered gravitational conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11053165/,"Abstract One of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository. Such exhaustive mining shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceflight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a variety of altered gravity conditions.","Studies from spaceflight and ground analog experiments confirmed that altered gravity environment causes multiple physiological alterations to both mouse and human musculoskeletal, immune, cardiovascular, vestibular, integumentary, and nervous system, including biological processes such as metabolism of skeletal muscle, bone formation response, inflammatory response, apoptosis and cell proliferation in PBLs, impaired activation of T cells, stem cell differentiation, cell cycle disruption in hair follicles, neuron morphogenesis, neuronal synaptic signaling and migration, cell morphology and diverging cell cycle in cancer cell lines. The increased correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370, despite a reduced number of common genes, indicates potential biologically relevant similarities between these two experiments, which may not be evident when considering the larger gene set. The CHRND gene (associated with acetylcholine binding, acetylcholine receptor activity, acetylcholine-activated cation-selective channel activity, ligand-gated ion channel activity), CHAD gene (related to protein kinase inhibitor activity), and RRAD gene (associated with GTP binding, GTPase activity, calmodulin binding, protein binding) were significant upregulated on two different human experiments, OSD-195 and OSD-370 both studying vastus lateralis tissue."

Dichotomous effects on lymphatic transport with loss of caveolae in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513672/,"While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominate route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Methods: Various aspects of lymphatic transport were measured in mice constitutively lacking caveolin-1 (“CavKO”), the protein required for caveolae formation in endothelial cells, and in mice with a LEC-specific Cav1 gene deletion (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1 flox/flox ; “LyCav”) and ex vivo in their vessels and cells. The lymphatic conductance, or initial tissue uptake, was significantly higher in both CavKO mice and LyCav mice by quantitative microlymphangiography and the permeability to 70kDa dextran was significantly increased in monolayers of LECs isolated from CavKO mice. Conclusion: Macromolecule transport across lymphatics is increased with loss of caveolae, yet phasic contractility reduced, resulting in reduced overall lymphatic transport function.","Micropuncture was used in this study to measure interstitial fluid pressure; use of another method, such as wick-in-needle could yield different values and thus alter the calculation of hydraulic conductivity and lymphatic conductance 19 , 23 . Many factors that regulate blood vascular tone, however, also impact lymphatic tone and contractility, such as luminal flow rates, sympathetic signaling, calcium flux, and nitric oxide activity; these regulatory mechanisms often have caveolae as a critical component. Beyond the demonstrated NO effect, we have not identified if these other cellular regulators of the contractile response are altered in lymphatics in these models, but they likely play additional roles in the impaired contractility measured in collecting lymphatic vessels lacking caveolae."

When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R 2 = 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection.","This study shows that Earth-based indoor environments are much more diverse compared to the ISS, which has fewer occupants, no pets (although mouse experiments are often onboard), no outdoor contributions, and different types of materials and ventilation. This study shows that there are clear differences in a highly regulated government owned and operated spacecraft and these changes can become increasingly important as new station designs, with larger, more varied crews, and commercial objectives launch into low-Earth orbit. This understanding can help us to maintain a healthy indoor microbiome on spacecraft during both increased activity in low-Earth orbit and long duration human-occupied space travel, to promote crew health 17 , spacecraft integrity 31 , and planetary protection 32 ."
Predicting how varying moisture conditions impact the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11386075/,"Abstract Background The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Results Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.","Due to these many potential sources of daily elevated moisture conditions, it is critical to understand how fungal and bacterial communities in spacecraft dust will react when receiving ideal growth conditions, namely water availability, and how this can affect crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection plans. For future missions, especially beyond low-Earth orbit, understanding the microbes present and how they may grow will be essential to mitigate any potential negative impacts on crew health and safety due to microbial-related illness or material degradation. The results are also affected by the dust sampling protocol for returned vacuum bags, which were triple-sealed and stored at room temperature while awaiting return to Earth in which time microbial communities may have been altered."
Aging and estrogen status: A possible endothelium-dependent vascular coupling mechanism in bone remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502426/,"Abstract Bone loss with aging and menopause may be linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R 2 = 0.630; P<0.001). These data demonstrate parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and BV/TV, and provide for a possible coupling mechanism linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone remodeling.","We hypothesize that one such mechanism is related to bone vascular endothelial function and its ability to 1) directly influence bone cell activity through local release of endothelium-derived signaling molecules such as NO and PGI 2 , , and 2) to regulate skeletal perfusion, which could indirectly affect bone cell activity through its impact on fluid filtration out of the vascular compartment and, correspondingly, interstitial fluid pressure in bone , – . Additionally, a recent study has reported that a program of low-intensity endurance exercise training that elicits low mechanical strain on bone restores endothelial NO-mediated vasodilation of the PNA and increases trabecular bone volume and mineral density in the distal femur of old male rats . This conclusion of a coupling mechanism between the bone vasculature and bone mass is further supported by two studies in humans, where forearm conduit artery endothelial vasodilator responsiveness, used as a surrogate measure of bone endothelial function, was positively correlated with lumbar spine bone mineral density in postmenopausal women , ."
Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856860/,"The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control rats. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the PNA with HU that later returned to control levels with the reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness, respectively. The results demonstrate that chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate acute reloading due, in part, to a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature.","Given that chronic changes in local hemodynamic conditions (e.g., blood flow and arterial pressure) can induce vascular remodeling and impact tissue blood flow capacity [ 23 – 25 ], the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether 7-d and 14-d of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow perfusion and vascular resistance during reloading, and to investigate whether putative changes in bone blood flow during reloading are associated with a structural remodeling of the femoral PNA. Collectively, these studies suggest several types of unloading-induced vascular adaptations in bone: 1) a narrowing of bone resistance arteries [present study], which could negatively impact the bulk flow of oxygen and nutrients into bone, cellular transport, and ultimately the bulk fluid flow through capillaries into the interstitial spaces [ 9 , 10 , 35 ], and 2) rarefaction of the bone microvascular network and supporting infrastructure [ 17 , 36 , 38 ], which among other things could impair potential signaling between the vascular endothelium and bone remodeling units [ 11 , 14 – 16 ]. Although there is no evidence that unloading-induced decrements in blood flow during reloading are severe enough to provoke osteonecrosis, an underperfusion of bone and marrow could have adverse effects on bone structure and health, particularly if the energetic requirements of metabolically active bone cells exceed the capacity of the vasculature to provide sufficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients."
Differential effects of aging and exercise on intra-abdominal adipose arteriolar function and blood flow regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3615599/,"Abstract Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1 ) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2 ) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed.","In the latter two studies, it should be noted that despite plasma NE concentrations reaching a steady state within 5–10 min, significant changes in AT blood flow did not occur until 15–30 min after NE infusion began, thus suggesting that a prolonged exposure is required to elicit changes in vascular conductance. However, with longer durations of exercise, blood flow to AT increases, likely consequent to an increased delivery of free fatty acids from AT ( 25 ), suggesting that any initial vasoconstriction during exercise onset is modified later by circulating humoral or endocrine factors ( 25 ) and possibly tachyphylaxia of adrenergic receptors ( 66 ). There are several potential mechanisms for the lower flow at rest with old age, including 1 ) diminished vascular endothelial function ( 8 , 17 , 63 ); 2 ) elevated oxidative stress from AT ( 4 ), which may diminish the bioavailabilty of nitric oxide; and 3 ) significantly elevated basal SNS activity with old age ( 53 ), offsetting a diminished α-adrenergic sensitivity ( Table 1 )."
Effects of spaceflight and ground recovery on mesenteric artery and vein constrictor properties in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4050424/,"Abstract Following exposure to microgravity, there is a reduced ability of astronauts to augment peripheral vascular resistance, often resulting in orthostatic hypotension. Mesenteric arteries and veins from female mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS)-131 ( n =11), STS-133 ( n =6), and STS-135 ( n =3) shuttle missions and respective ground-based control mice ( n =30) were isolated for in vitro experimentation. Vasoconstrictor responses were evoked in arteries via norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and caffeine, and in veins through NE across a range of intraluminal pressures (2–12 cmH 2 O). The results indicate that the impaired vasoconstriction following spaceflight occurs through the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca 2+ release mechanism.","Alternative mechanisms have been proposed to underlie reductions in responsiveness of central arteries to NE, including enhanced endothelial-dependent vasodilation (offsetting vasoconstriction), and atrophic vascular remodeling resulting in a reduction in medial wall thickness and medial cross-sectional area. Time course of arterial recovery from spaceflight Impairment of vasoconstrictor responsiveness of mesenteric resistance arteries may underlie, at least in part, the orthostatic hypotension evident in humans following spaceflight (3, 6–9, 70), given that ∼20% of the increase in PVR comes from the splanchnic region on standing ( 71 ). The precise mechanisms for the recovered vasoconstriction are presently unknown, but the time frame of recovery ( i.e ., 2–5 d) is similar to that required to fully restore ryanodine receptor function and caffeine-induced Ca 2+ release in mesenteric artery vascular smooth muscle cells after simulated microgravity ( 53 )."
"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: Implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659353/,"Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.—Taylor, C.","Thus, findings from groups studying both ground-based analogs of microgravity and actual microgravity, in humans and rodents, show disparate results of greater vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries ( 14 ) and lower perfusion ( 13 , 14 , 45 ) in ground models, whereas there is less cerebral artery vasoconstriction and indications of higher perfusion both during and following spaceflight (present study and ref. For example, in HDT rats, the peripheral arterial circulation shows diminished vasoconstriction regardless of whether it is exposed to higher or lower P a ; diminished vasoconstrictor responsiveness has been reported to occur in carotid arteries ( 54 ) and the thoracic aorta ( 55 ) where P a is elevated during HDT ( 7 , 13 ), in mesenteric arteries near the hydrostatic indifference point of rats ( 56 , 57 ), and in arterial segments of the lower hindlimb region ( 54 , 58 ) where P a is reduced with HDT ( 7 ). Therefore, we propose that the chronic vasodilator influence of CO 2 may compromise the tightness of the junctions between endothelial cells that make up the blood-brain barrier in the cerebral circulation during spaceflight and enable the unknown factors affecting the peripheral circulation to likewise diminish the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries, thereby compromising autoregulation of cerebral perfusion and facilitating elevations in intracranial pressure."
Exercise training augments regional bone and marrow blood flow during exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4169763/,"Abstract Introduction The principal nutrient artery to the femur demonstrates an increase in nitric oxide mediated vasodilation in rats after treadmill exercise training. Methods Six-eight month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exercise trained (ET) with treadmill walking at 15 m/min up a 15° incline for 60 min/d over a 10–12 wk period. Blood flow to nine distinct regions of the femur, tibia, and fibula were determined at rest and during low-intensity exercise (15 m/min walking, 0° incline) using the reference sample microsphere method. Elevations in regional bone and marrow blood flow after training may augment medullary pressure and bone interstitial fluid flow, thus benefiting bone integrity.","Exercise has favorable effects on the molecular environment supporting a healthy endothelium as evidenced by improvements in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression ( 2 , 37 , 38 ), increased eNOS Serine 1177 phosphorylation, improved antioxidant enzyme expression (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase), and reduced expression of oxidant generating enzymes such as xanthine oxidase ( 18 ). For example, recent work has shown that prolonged skeletal disuse in hindlimb unloaded rats induces a narrowing of the maximal diameter of the femur PNA ( 39 ) and rarefaction of the microvascular network ( 14 ), both of which result in a lower femoral bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance with reloading ( 39 ). Such increases in bone blood flow during chronic bouts of exercise in ET rats likely generate increases in endothelial shear stress in the bone vasculature that facilitate the release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), and prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) that each may have important paracrine effects on bone cells ( 8 , 12 , 33 )."
Effects of Skeletal Unloading on the Vasomotor Properties of the Rat Femur Principal Nutrient Artery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398884/,"Previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and with subsequent reloading in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats, an animal model of chronic disuse. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of unloading on the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), the main conduit for blood flow to the femur, in 2 wk HU and control (CON) rats. Vasodilation through endothelium-dependent [acetylcholine, bradykinin, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD)] and endothelium-independent mechanisms [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and adenosine] were also determined. These data indicate that unloading-induced decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance are not the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries but are associated with reductions in endothelium-dependent vasodilation.","Collectively, these data demonstrate that HU has little effect on smooth muscle vasoconstrictor, vasodilator, or mechanical function in bone resistance arteries and, consequently, indicate that these are not mechanisms for the higher long bone vascular resistance during either unloading or subsequent reloading. ( 12 ) proposed that bone loss associated with unloading could be impacted by several cardiovascular factors, including 1 ) reduced bone interstitial fluid flow subsequent to decrements in bone and marrow blood flow, and 2 ) impairment of mechanisms directly coupling vascular endothelial cell signaling with bone cell activity (i.e., osteoclasts, osteocytes, and osteoblasts). In support of this notion, studies have shown that both decreases and increases in cancellous bone volume are associated with impairment and enhancement of bone vascular endothelial function, respectively, with aging ( 46 ), altered estrogen status ( 45 , 48 , 53 ), and low-impact exercise training ( 19 )."
Type 2 diabetes alters bone and marrow blood flow and vascular control mechanisms in the ZDF rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379453/,"Responses of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur from obese ZDF rats with prediabetes, short-term diabetes, and long-term diabetes to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and –independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilation, and KCl, norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstrictor were determined in vitro . Endothelium-dependent and –independent vasodilation were reduced, and norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction were enhanced in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes relative to lean age-matched controls. Differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N G -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance, measured in vivo using radiolabeled microspheres, were lower in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes.","Further, the results suggest that this is due to an impairment of endothelial NO signaling, as indicated by the elimination of differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation between PNAs from obese ZDF rats and age-matched lean controls when NOS inhibition is present. Results from the present study indicate that NO signaling from the vasculature is the more important molecule in the apparent coupling of endothelium-dependent vasodilation to BMD, given that differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in PNAs from obese and lean ZDF rats were abolished by NOS inhibition alone ( Figs. The ZDF rat utilized in the present study was originally derived from the Zucker obese rat strain via select inbreeding of animals that spontaneously demonstrated unusually high blood glucose levels ( Peterson, et al."
Spaceflight on the Bion-M1 biosatellite alters cerebral artery vasomotor and mechanical properties in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4385880/,"Abstract Conditions during spaceflight, such as the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector, are thought to potentially alter cerebral blood flow and vascular resistance. Basilar arteries isolated from spaceflight (SF) ( n = 6), habitat control (HC) ( n = 6), and vivarium control (VC) ( n = 16) mice were used for in vitro functional and mechanical testing and histological structural analysis. The pressure-diameter relation was lower in arteries from SF mice relative to that in HC mice, which was not related to differences in the extracellular matrix protein elastin or collagen content or the elastin/collagen ratio in the basilar arteries. These results suggest that the microgravity-induced attenuation of both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties may limit the range of vascular control of cerebral perfusion or impair the distribution of brain blood flow during periods of stress.","Considering sex and age, although differences in these variables existed between the groups of mice studied from the Space Shuttle and Bion-M1 missions (shuttle: 11-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice; Bion-M1: 19- to 20-wk-old male C57BL/6N mice), further research is needed to determine whether animal sex or such age differences are sufficient to drive adaptation of cerebral artery mechanical properties in opposite directions. The present results are also consistent with studies of cerebral arteries isolated from head-down tail-suspended rats, a ground-based animal model to simulate microgravity, which have shown diminished endothelial NO synthase (NOS) protein expression ( 64 ) and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the NOS mechanism ( 44 , 72 , 73 ). Despite the evidence to infer elevations in brain blood flow during spaceflight, decrements in cerebral artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation and reductions in vascular distensibility suggest that the effects of spaceflight on cerebral blood flow may not be so clear, as also reflected by studies reporting increases ( 4 , 6 , 24 , 25 , 40 , 43 , 56 , 59 , 69 ), no change ( 5 , 7 , 74 ), or decreases ( 10 , 74 ) in cerebral perfusion in astronauts and cosmonauts."
Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4964660/,"Abstract As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.","While traveling from LEO to the Moon and back, the Apollo lunar astronauts traversed regions of geomagnetically trapped electrons and protons known as the Van Allen belts and, depending on the duration of their mission and the specific activities in which they were engaged (e.g., lunar surface and intravehicular Command and Lunar Module activities), were continuously subjected to varying levels of high-energy cosmic rays 31 . If we assume representative shielding scenarios (10 g/cm 2 ) for the Apollo Command Module and radiation quality factors drawn from the most recent International Commission on Radiological Protection 33 , then the average radiation dose from the galactic cosmic rays to the Apollo astronauts would be approximately 0.295 cGy, or roughly half the total dose during their lunar excursions 9 . Only in the last decade, when multiple spacefaring nations and corporate entities have announced plans to embark on manned exploratory missions to Mars and prolonged habitation on the Moon, has biomedical research been directed towards identifying possible CVD risks associated with the deep space radiation environment."
Effects of age and exercise training on coronary microvascular smooth muscle phenotype and function,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866446/,"At the end of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary arterioles. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype.","We now report that with age, the vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles undergoes a loss of contractile protein expression and an increase in expression of ribosomal protein S6, a key synthetic protein, suggesting that the increase in wall thickness that occurs with age in these arterioles results from a phenotypic switch in which the vascular smooth muscle cells lose contractile stiffness and become increasingly synthetic and hypertrophic. Importantly, in resistance arterioles that are critical for regulation of coronary blood flow distribution, the switch from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype in the vascular smooth muscle corresponds to a loss of functional contractility, possibly contributing to the microvascular dysfunction that occurs in the coronary circulation with age ( 13 ). Therefore, to investigate one potential systemic mechanism that may contribute to the age- and exercise training-induced phenotypic shifts in the vascular smooth muscle of coronary arterioles, we studied circulating adiponectin and its downstream effector, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)."
Impact of Spaceflight and Artificial Gravity on the Mouse Retina: Biochemical and Proteomic Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165321/,"To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the µg group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups ( p < 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in µg mice compared to HC animals. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes.","The results indicate that spaceflight induces changes in neuronal structure, cellular organization, mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation and inflammation which, in turn, may lead to tissue injury and late neurodegeneration. Another possible explanation for the lack of significant change in 4-HNE in the current study is that spaceflight might elicit protective effects in the central nervous system (CNS) by inhibiting some gravity-initiated stress signaling pathway. Another study of the same animals used in our present study also showed that 1 g AG served to maintain femur bone density and soleus/gastrocnemius muscle mass similar to that in the ground control group, whereas significant decreases in bone density and muscle mass occurred in the flight mice without centrifuge [ 10 ]."
Simulated microgravity induces regionally distinct neurovascular and structural remodeling of skeletal muscle and cutaneous arteries in the rat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7339929/,"This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and skin. Methods : Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and saphenous) were examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion and glyoxylic acid staining. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls.","Therefore, the design of this study allowed us to separate adaptive arterial responses to the anti-orthostatic body position and redistribution of support and muscle activity from other effects associated with the HU model, including social isolation, restraint, and the development of neuroendocrine stress ( Tsvirkun et al., 2012 ). This suggestion is based on several observations from the present and earlier published studies: (1) the higher sensitivity to constrictors was observed in densely innervated saphenous artery but not in the sparsely innervated sural artery; (2) HU reduced the density of adrenergic plexus in saphenous arteries; and (3) denervated vessels are well-known to become hyper-sensitive to various constrictor agonists and high-K + depolarization ( Bevan, 1984 ; Bentzer et al., 1997 ; Tarasova et al., 2006 ). Post-denervation hyper-sensitivity occurs without changes in total density or affinity of post-junctional α 1 -adrenoceptors ( Dalessandri et al., 1991 ; Taki et al., 2004 ), indicating its mechanisms of effect are downstream to the receptors and may include depolarization of smooth muscle cells ( Fleming, 1999 ), facilitation of L-type Ca 2+ -channel-dependent signaling ( Heumann et al., 2016 ), Ca 2+ -sensitization of smooth muscle contractile machinery ( Puzdrova et al., 2014 ), and altered cell-to-cell coupling ( Slovut et al., 2004 )."
Spaceflight decelerates the epigenetic clock orchestrated with a global alteration in DNA methylome and transcriptome in the mouse retina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8220224/,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in the retina or alters the epigenetic clock. The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were maintained under similar housing conditions. We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. This study demonstrates that spaceflight impacts the retina at the epigenomic and transcriptomic levels, and such changes could be involved in the etiology of eye-related disorders among astronauts.","Approximately one in three astronauts flying on long-duration space missions experience visual impairment and morphologic changes to their eyes that include choroidal and retinal folds, optic disc edema, focal areas of retinal ischemia (i.e., cotton wool spots), globe flattening, and hyperopic shifts. A variety of potential mechanisms have also been proposed to account for the unusual physiologic and pathologic neuro-ophthalmic findings, including elevations in intracranial pressure (ICP) from cephalad fluid shifts, altered autoregulation of cerebral perfusion, impaired cerebrospinal fluid drainage from the brain and orbital optic nerve sheath through venous, glymphatic, and lymphatic drainage systems, and disruption of blood-brain, blood-retinal, and blood-optic nerve barrier function. The differential gene expression analysis revealed a few distinctive yet interconnected pathways that may have been affected by spaceflight, such as inflammatory and cancer-prone pathways, i.e., interleukin and chemokine pathways ( Fgfr1, Fos, Cxcr4 genes); cell structure maintenance pathways, i.e., ECM and keratins; and the cell death, cell differentiation, and survival pathways, i.e., VEGF, TSP1, TGF-β signaling and DNA repair."
Development of otolith receptors in Japanese quail.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910419/,"The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post-hatch day P7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non-polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at E6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at E8.","Afferent development It is known that in chicks and mice, at E5 and E13.5 respectively, vestibular hair cells begin to differentiate and migrate toward the epithelial surface early in development, ( Friedmann, 1969 ; Ruben, 1967 ; Goodyear et al., 1995 ); before nerve fiber penetration into the sensory epithelium occurs ( Friedmann, 1969 ). In fact, it has been reported that hair cells release neurotrophins, including BDNF and NT3, which are known to bind to specific afferent receptors (TrkB and TrkC, respectively) to direct growing fibers toward their targets ( Ernfors et al., 1995 ; Fritzsch et al., 1998 ; Tessarollo et al., 2004 ). Since bouton fibers appear to trans-differentiate into dimorph units, it is also likely that some fraction of the dimorph fibers become induced (by as yet unknown factors) to shed their small branch segments with bouton endings and trans-differentiate into calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells."
Spatial and temporal characteristics of vestibular convergence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166430/,"In the current study, we used discrete rotational and translational motion stimuli to characterize canal- and otolith-driven response components of convergent non-eye movement (NEM) neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex of alert pigeons. When compared to afferent responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation. Convergent otolith signals also had similar mean gain and phase values to the afferent population but were spatially well-matched with the corresponding canal signals, cell-by-cell. However, neither response component alone nor a simple linear combination of these components was sufficient to predict actual net responses during combined canal-otolith stimulation.","For pigeons and other lateral-eyed animals, both canal and otolith stimulation contribute to compensatory eye and head responses that stabilize gaze during rotation relative to gravity (i.e. EHA rotation; pigeon: Dickman and Angelaki 1999 ; Dickman, Beyer and Hess 2000 ; McArthur and Dickman 2008 ; mouse: Harrod and Baker 2003 ; rat: Brettler et al. Thus, despite these possible sources of error in our characterization of the otolith-driven input, we believe that the failure of the linear summation model to predict EHA response sensitivity and phase indicates that convergent neurons are carrying out real nonlinear integration of canal and otolith inputs. It may be necessary for pigeons to spatially match canal and otolith inputs in the brainstem in order to use the otolith-driven net linear acceleration signal to enhance the performance of the VOR and VCR along short-latency reflex pathways ( McArthur and Dickman 2008 )."
Bone remodeling is regulated by inner ear vestibular signals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615562/,"Abstract Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Consistent with those observations, we found that Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of Ca V 1.2 TS mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the Ca V 1.2-dependent Ca 2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions.","Expression of the gain-of-function Ca V 1.2 TS mutant channel in our Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice affected the overall morphology of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, which display reduced sculpting (see the stapedial crura) and an osteopetrotic phenotype that are strikingly similar to those seen in Rankl −/− , Fos −/− and Csf1 op/op osteoclastic defect mice [ 4 ], suggesting that the anticatabolic effect of increased Ca 2+ signaling through Ca V 1.2 TS contributed to the morphological changes in theses bones. While this is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, showing that modulating Ca 2+ signal via Ca V 1.2 in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule regulates osteoclastogenesis and bone modeling/remodeling in the middle and inner ear, our data are consistent with previous observations from others and us that Ca V 1.2 regulates OPG expression and secretion from osteoblasts [ 25 , 28 ]. Although this correlation has not been consistently observed, and the underlying mechanism of effect of fluoride on otosclerosis has not been sufficiently established, it is intriguing that fluoride, which plays an important role in both bone formation and homeostasis of bone mineral metabolism [ 36 ], has been shown to affect Ca 2+ homeostasis in many types of cells such as in proximal tubules [ 37 , 38 ], fibroblasts [ 39 ], cardiomyocytes [ 40 ], as well as osteoblasts [ 41 ]."
Simulated Microgravity Enhances Oligodendrocyte Mitochondrial Function and Lipid Metabolism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324008/,"Abstract The primary energy sources of mammalian cells are proteins, fats and sugars that are processed by well-known biochemical mechanisms that have been discovered and studied in 1G (terrestrial gravity). Here we sought to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-μG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. The secretome study also revealed a significant increase in the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids such as, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (5.67), lysolipids like 1-oleoyl-GPE (4.48) were also increased by microgravity. For centuries, basic developmental biology research has been the pillar to an array of discoveries that have led to clinical applications; we believe that studies using microgravity will open new avenues to our understanding of the brain in health and disease, in particular, to the discovery of new molecules and mechanisms impossible to unveil while in 1G.","Conjugation with carnitine is a prerequisite for long-chain FAs in order to be transferred across the mitochondrial membrane; we found that with exception of acetylcarnitine, all the other acylcarnitines were below the threshold of detection suggesting a high activity of FAs transport into mitochondria for oxidation and energy production. Additionally, in our hands for an optimal OL development, OLs in culture when in 1G, require of GDM (glial chemically defined medium; Espinosa et al., 2009 and 2016 ) to support the optimal development of immature OL and to reach the mature myelinating stage they require OLDEM (OL defined medium) the OL medium formulation designed to support the production of myelin enzymes and myelin membrane by cultured OLs ( Yuan et al., 1992 ). Numerous studies remain to be performed in order to understand how this new knowledge is applicable to astronauts experiencing long-term space travel and intracranial hypertension which occurs in microgravity and continues to affect them when back to earth."
Human Neural Stem Cells Flown into Space Proliferate and Generate Young Neurons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412175/,"Electrophysiological recordings of space NSC-derived neurons showed immature cell membrane properties characterized by small capacitance and very high input resistance. No spontaneous synaptic events could be detected, suggesting their immature status even though most recorded cells displayed complex morphology and numerous cell processes. Ascertaining the origin of the NSCs′ increased energy requirement is of the essence in order to design effective measures to minimize health risks associated with long-duration human spaceflight missions. Keywords: neural stem cells, pluripotency, space flight, microgravity, proliferation, neuronal specification, neurons, energetics, glycolysis","Silvano’s team reported data supporting that simulated microgravity arrests cell proliferation, albeit in a transient manner, and they also found that these changes were not permanent as NSCs recovered their proliferative capacity when they were returned to normal gravity. Therefore, the reasons for the apparent contradiction may be due to the following: (1) the extent of the exposure to microgravity, which might be a determinant for the arrest of cell proliferation in Silvano’s study or (2) perhaps simulated microgravity differs from space microgravity with respect to the regulation of neural cells and their biological processes. Two of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production, glucose and pyruvate, were decreased after just 3 days in microgravity, while lactate levels increased considerably indicating that OLs switched to anaerobic glycolysis in order to meet the energy demands elicited by microgravity [ 11 ]."

Space Microgravity Alters Neural Stem Cell Division: Implications for Brain Cancer Research on Earth and in Space,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9699585/,"Abstract Considering the imminence of long-term space travel, it is necessary to investigate the impact of space microgravity (SPC-µG) in order to determine if this environment has consequences on the astronauts’ health, in particular, neural and cognitive functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-µG resulted in enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-µG as well as secretome exposure compared to ground control (1G) NSCs. These findings provide new insights into the potential health implications of space travel and have far-reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms leading to the deleterious effects of long-term space travel as well as potential carcinogenic susceptibility.","Nonetheless, the results from the naïve NSCs treated with secretome demonstrate that the space environment induces the production and secretion of soluble factors that exert the same behavior on normal self-renewing cells (i.e., naïve NSCs), resulting in ACD without changing the mechanical forces. Having previously seen enhanced proliferation and hypertrophy [ 8 ], and in the current study hyperplasia, in our NSCs post-flight, it is easy to speculate that SPARC under different gravity conditions such as on Mars or our Moon will be differentially regulated according to the G-force the cells are subjected to. A future genomics profiling study, looking into the expression of the MYCN gene as well as other proto-oncogenes associated with defects in cell division and proliferation could further research into the potential connection between the abnormalities seen following SPC-µG exposure and cancer cells."
Oligodendrocyte Progenitors Display Enhanced Proliferation and Autophagy after Space Flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9953055/,"Abstract Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the consequences of long-term space missions. Examination of the proteomic profile of the secretome of space flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) revealed that the stress protein heat shock protein-90 beta “HSP-90β” was the 5 th most enriched (6.8 times) and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine “SPARC” was the 7 th most enriched (5.2 times), with respect to ground control cells. Given the roles and importance of these two proteins in mammalian cells’ metabolism, their upregulation may hold the key to modulating cell proliferation and autophagy, in order to mitigate ICP and VIIP during and after space missions. Keywords: space flight, oligodendrocyte progenitors, autophagy, proliferation, visual impairment intracranial pressure, intracranial hypertension, SPARC, HSP-90","Initially, space-flown OLPs appeared to have not proliferated significantly more after space flight when compared to GC-OLPs. Nonetheless, a more exhaustive analysis demonstrated the existence of three subpopulations of OLPs, one exhibiting a long cell cycle similar in length to the GC cells, and two exhibiting shorter cell cycles of either 6.6 h or 3.3 h. Although our resources and cell numbers obtained after space flight did not allow for epigenetic analyses, the proteomic analysis of SPC-flown secretome was very instrumental: it revealed that while in space, OLPs secreted 3.5 times more transferrin than GC-OLPs, indicating that they were at an early OLP stage while in space [ 3 ]. 4.4. Benefits Expected for Humanity on Earth Originally, our long-term goal was and still is to produce healthy, transplantable, and functional OLPs in adequate numbers to be used for cell replacement therapies to treat myelin deficiencies and cerebral palsy on Earth."
Metabolomics profile of the secretome of space-flown oligodendrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10528075/,"Abstract Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the sequels of long-term space missions. Here we sought to determine how space microgravity (µG) impacts the metabolomics profile of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system. In addition, our global metabolomics approach allowed for the discovery of endogenous metabolites secreted by OLPs while in space that are significantly modulated by microgravity. The functional and molecular relevance of these specific pathways are promising targets for therapeutic intervention for humans in long-term space missions to the moon, Mars and beyond.","In addition, more lactate (produced during anaerobic oxidation to fulfill energy needs) was also significantly released by the SPC OLPs. The use of extra energy in the SPC OLPs cannot be explained through a stimulation of myelin synthesis; glycerate, a building element in the formation of triglycerides, was secreted by these cells, indicating that they were still at the immature developmental stage, while the 1G OLPs may have been moving forward towards maturation as previously demonstrated by Tran et al. Further studies are needed to ascertain the causes of such enhanced energy consumption by OLPs. 4.2. Glutamate Metabolism The glutamate pathway is a hub: glutamate forms from glutamine via deamination through phosphate-activated glutaminase; it is fed by the glycolysis (with alanine as a by-product); glutamate is also a co-substrate in all reactions catalyzed by aminotransferases, which convert it to α-KG, a key intermediate of the TCA cycle [ 31 ]; glutamate generates energy itself (NADH). This is important because the excessive stimulation of neurons by glutamate that can be caused by energy deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium overload leads to an excitotoxicity that is characterized by the exacerbation of glutamate receptors, triggering a cascade of toxic effects that leads to neuronal cell death [ 44 , 45 ] and, consequently, nearly all brain functions, including learning and memory, are affected."
Metabolomic profiling of the secretome from human neural stem cells flown into space.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10813126/,"Abstract The change in gravitational force has a significant effect on biological tissues and the entire organism. In this study, we analyzed the effect of µG on neural stem cells (NSCs) following a space flight to the International Space Station (ISS). After 3 days in space, analysis of the metabolome in culture medium revealed increased glycolysis with augmented pyruvate and glycerate levels, and activated catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glutamine. NSCs flown into space (SPC-NSCs) also showed increased synthesis of NADH and formation of polyamine spermidine when compared to ground controls (GC-NSCs).","This activates the TCA cycle for more efficient aerobic energy production, as lactate levels declined significantly in 1 G-NSCs. In line with our findings, Chiang and collaborators exposed human NSCs to simulated µG and found an increase in cell proliferation, supported by enhanced mitochondrial function [ 8 ]. As subproducts of amino acid catabolism, the polyamine spermidine plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and is involved in cell growth and proliferation, tissue regeneration, DNA and RNA stabilization, enzymatic modulation, and regulation of translation, among others [ 28 , 29 , 30 ]. The potential influence of IR on the NSCs in our study is likely mitigated by the short-term exposure of the NSCs to IR and the protection that the Earth’s magnetic field exerts against Solar Particle Events, since the ISS is in a low Earth orbit, although it does not shield from Galactic Cosmic Radiation, which is composed of high-charge and energy particles."
"Strategies, research priorities, and challenges for the exploration of space beyond low-Earth orbit",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10390562/,"The roadmap summarizes (1) key neurobehavioral challenges associated with spaceflight, (2) the need to consider sex as a biological variable, (3) the use of integrative omics technologies to elucidate mechanisms underlying changes in the brain and behavior, and (4) the importance of understanding the neural representation of gravity throughout the brain and its multisensory processing. We then highlight the need for a variety of target-specific countermeasures, and a personalized administration schedule as two critical strategies for mitigating potentially adverse effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system and performance. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs and stress the importance of new collaborative strategies across agencies and researchers for fostering an integrative cross- and transdisciplinary approach from cells, molecules to neural circuits and cognitive performance. Finally, we highlight that space research in neurocognitive science goes beyond monitoring and mitigating risks in astronauts but could also have significant benefits for the population on Earth.","As space-faring nations across the globe are fueling a new race of human space exploration that goes well beyond the Moon, national agencies and private entities across the globe have accelerated the research and development that will promote the safety and success of such missions. Future work in this field should be characterized by an interdisciplinary approach that promotes collaborations across space agencies, considers sex as a biological variable, and integrates multimodal brain imaging, psychological and behavioral, neurovestibular, cardiovascular, omics, sleep, and circadian data. The knowledge from such approaches could go beyond their application to spaceflight and translate to the prevention and treatment of various clinical conditions on Earth including but not limited to neurogenerative diseases."
Spaceflight Induces Specific Alterations in the Proteomes of Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4290804/,"Abstract Life in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.","Basically, enough protein was recovered from roots and leaves of 12-day-old plants from half a 10 cm 2 Petri plate to conduct proteomic analyses rich enough to return the identities of 1570 proteins and to conduct quantitation on 1432 proteins with iTRAQ methods and relying on at least three unique peptides per protein. The proteomic data from this study of three combined Arabidopsis lines support the general notion that plants engage specific metabolic responses to accomplish physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but that response is different among organs (Paul et al. Cell wall modifications in spaceflight, in addition to or governed by auxin signaling, may be one of those general and recurring metabolic adaptations that may be in common among plants and plant tissues, even if enacted by various proteins and genes that differ among cell types or genotypes."
The effect of spaceflight on the gravity-sensing auxin gradient of roots: GFP reporter gene microscopy on orbit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515520/,"Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.","This diversity provided the opportunity to observe auxin signaling in two different ISS growth habitats and two distinct spaceflight experiences separated by several months, which thereby removed the possibility of experiment processing, or local environmental factors other than spaceflight, impacting the results. In addition, exploration of sites of auxin action away from the root tip, such as shoots, root flanks and junctions, as well as lateral roots, would provide valuable additional insights into the spaceflight influences on auxin roles in plants not experiencing unit gravity. There is unintended and unrealized bias in some of the terminology used to describe the gravity response mechanisms and models of primary roots, in that there is an unwritten implication that the default or resting auxin distribution of the primary root is set up by gravity; that it is the vertical orientation that sets up the auxin distribution in the root tip."
Skewing in Arabidopsis roots involves disparate environmental signaling pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5286820/,"In this study, transcriptome data were derived from two Arabidopsis ecotypes, WS and Col-0, under three tilted growth conditions in order to identify candidate genes involved in skewing. Results This work identifies a number of genes that are likely involved in skewing, using growth conditions that differentially affect skewing and waving. Comparing the gene expression profiles of WS and Col-0 in different tilted growth conditions identified 11 candidate genes as potentially involved in the control of skewing. These 11 genes are involved in several different cellular processes, including sugar transport, salt signaling, cell wall organization, and hormone signaling.","Transcriptome comparisons between ecotypes revealed a different set of 128 genes that may be involved in skewing Comparing gene expression patterns between WS and Col-0 shows how the ecotypes cope with the same environmental challenges presented to them, in this case whether the angle of the growth plate produces skewed roots.

Genetic dissection of the Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome: Are some responses dispensable for the physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491145/,"Abstract Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.","In other words, much of the Col-0 spaceflight response can be eliminated with a simple mutation in PhyD, without apparently compromising plant health or development or adding stress responses at the gene expression level. It is important to note that the 18 genes shared among the differentially expressed genes of all three genotypes in the light of the ISS are almost completely distinct from the 11 shared differentially expressed genes of the dark grown ISS plants; only one gene, ATARD3, is common to both sets ( Fig 5 ). Thus, in this experiment with three genotypes and two different ISS environments, there is only one universally differentially expressed gene in the root tips of spaceflight plants, and this gene is not represented in previously identified spaceflight transcriptomes."
Phenotypic characterization of an Arabidopsis T- DNA insertion line SALK_063500,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5996828/,"Abstract In this article we report the identification of a homozygous lethal T-DNA (transfer DNA) line within the coding region of the At1G05290 gene in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) line, SALK_063500.

In the heterozygous T-DNA allele the expression levels of AT1G05290 were compared to wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0, Columbia).

For gene expression analysis, Col-0 and SALK_063500 seeds were grown on 0.5% Phytagel TM plates (0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts [Invitrogen] containing 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, was adjusted to pH 5.72 with 1N KOH and solidified with 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel TM [Sigma]) at 22 °C under constant light condition . For in vitro pollen germination studies, mature pollen was harvested from flowers left at room temperate for 2 h, and then grown overnight on slides coated with solid pollen germinating media (18% Sucrose, 0.01% Boric Acid, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM Ca(NO3)2, 1 mM MgSO4 and 0.5% Noble agar [Difco] was adjusted to pH 7.0 ."
Utilization of single‚Äêimage normalized difference vegetation index (SI‚ÄêNDVI) for early plant stress detection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6201722/,"Abstract Premise of the Study An imaging system was refined to monitor the health of vegetation grown in controlled conditions using spectral reflectance patterns. To measure plant health, the single‐image normalized difference vegetation index (SI‐NDVI) compares leaf reflectance in visible and near‐infrared light spectrums. Images were analyzed using Fiji image processing software and Microsoft Excel to create qualitative false color images and quantitative graphs to detect plant stress. Early detection of plant stress is possible using SI‐NDVI imaging, which is both simpler to use and more cost efficient than traditional dual‐image NDVI or hyper‐spectral imaging.","Compared to traditional NDVI or hyper‐spectral imaging approaches, the dollar cost of implementing an SI‐NDVI imaging system is low because SI‐NDVI requires only one camera and can rely on completely free, open source software for analysis. This study demonstrated that SI‐NDVI imaging allows for detection of plant stress before it is apparent to the human eye, in controlled conditions using two of the many potential stresses that may be of interest in the laboratory or greenhouse. SI‐NDVI imaging has clear applications in the development of indoor farming practices, which are increasingly relied upon to provide fresh food to geographical areas not conducive to crop cultivation, such as in urban cities or areas of extreme temperature."
Comparing RNA-Seq and microarray gene expression data in two zones of the Arabidopsis root apex relevant to spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6240453/,"Abstract Premise of the Study The root apex is an important region involved in environmental sensing, but comprises a very small part of the root. The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined, comparing RNA sequencing (RNA‐Seq) to microarrays in characterizing genes that are relevant to spaceflight. Methods Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col‐0) roots were sectioned into Zone 1 (0.5 mm; root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone 2 (1.5 mm; transition, elongation, and growth‐terminating zone). These data suggest that techniques for dealing with small, rare samples from spaceflight can be further enhanced, and that RNA‐Seq may miss some spaceflight‐relevant changes in gene expression.","Although this general conclusion regarding RNA‐Seq in comparison to microarrays is widely accepted, the direct comparison of RNA‐Seq to microarray data obtained from the same spaceflight‐relevant tissue sets provides a unique perspective and a direct data set with which to baseline RNA‐Seq and microarray data within the existing spaceflight database within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s GeneLab ( Arabidopsis Data Repository; NASA GeneLab, 2018 ). The list of plant studies that examine gene expression patterns of root zones, and even root cell lineages, is ever expanding, particularly in recent years as tools and approaches provide increasing fidelity in the ability to discriminate among cell types (Birnbaum et al., 2003 ; Brady et al., 2007 ; Bruex et al., 2012 ; Kyndt et al., 2012 ; Bailey‐Serres, 2013 ; Gotté et al., 2016 ; Royer et al., 2016 ; Libault et al., 2017 ; Wendrich et al., 2017 ). RNA‐Seq was more efficient in identifying unique and novel transcripts that were not detected by microarray; however, at the read depths used here, which are generally accepted, RNA‐Seq failed to detect some spaceflight‐relevant genes of interest, suggesting that some studies may require extended read depths or require hybridization or RT‐qPCR methods to monitor low‐expressing genes."
Spaceflight-induced alternative splicing during seedling development in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6447593/,"Spaceflight triggers a response involving transcriptional re-programming and altered cell morphology, though many aspects of this response remain uncharacterized. We analyzed the spaceflight-induced transcriptome with a focus on genes that undergo alternative splicing to examine differential splicing associated with spaceflight—an unstudied characteristic of the molecular response to spaceflight exposure. RNA sequence data obtained during the APEX03 spaceflight experiment that was collected from two Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes at two seedling stages grown onboard the International Space Station, or as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center, were re-examined to detect alternative splicing differences induced by spaceflight. Presence/absence variation analysis was used to identify putative expression-level differences in alternatively spliced isoforms between spaceflight and ground controls and was followed by analysis of significant differential alternative splicing.",Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
The Plant Health Monitoring System of the EDEN ISS Space Greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 experiment phase,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7264257/,"The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. This paper shows in detail the data on edible and inedible biomass production of each crop grown in the EDEN ISS greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 season. Keywords: bio-regenerative life support system (BLSS), plant cultivation chamber, space plant growth facility, space food and nutrition, space analog studies, controlled environment agriculture (CEA)","Since cucumber have the highest production rate per unit area and time, the higher ratio of cucumber in the SPFGC harvest can explain the better overall production rate of fresh edible biomass compared to EDEN ISS to some degree. The dwarf tomato yield was basically equal to experiments with similar cultivars ( Spencer et al., 2019 ; Wang et al., 2019 ), but smaller compared to the BPC results ( Wheeler et al., 2008 ) which were most likely done with normal sized tomato crops. The difference in tomato production is most likely caused by the decision to grow less-effective dwarf tomato cultivars instead of normal sized high-productive tomatoes, while the much higher yield of cucumbers and lettuce can be explained by the absence of seasonal temperature and illumination changes which affect conventional greenhouse farming."
Root skewing-associated genes impact the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064724/,"Abstract The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings.","LEAs are responsive to ABA signaling resulting from osmotic, cold, and drought stresses and act to enhance stress resistance through membrane stabilization, sequestration of ROS, and prevention of protein aggregation ( Hundertmark and Hincha, 2008 ; Zhao et al., 2011 ; Candat et al., 2014 ; Fang and Xiong, 2015 ; Suzuki et al., 2016 ). The expression of a chloroplastic aldehyde reductase, ChlADR (AT1G54870), involved in the detoxification of reactive carbonyls formed as a result of lipid peroxidation, and TSPO, which participates in mobilization of lipids, are induced by stress and highly induced in the spaceflight acclimation of sku5 ( Guillaumot et al., 2009 ; Yamauchi et al., 2011 ; Jurkiewicz et al., 2018 ). While plants grown in microgravity may be more susceptible to pathogenic infection ( Leach et al., 2001 ; Ryba-White et al., 2001 ), the fact that all examples to date of upregulated pathogen response genes are from plants grown in sterile conditions suggests that these genes are serving other purposes of cell wall remodeling in spaceflight ( Paul et al., 2012b , 2013 , 2017 ; Correll et al., 2013 ; Choi et al., 2019 )."
Articular cartilage and sternal fibrocartilage respond differently to extended microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379395/,"To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained.","The finding of reduced proteoglycan levels in AC due to microgravity is consistent with hindlimb unloading and limb immobilization studies in rodents, dogs, and rabbits, which consistently report unloading-specific AC atrophy in multiple experimental situations (reviewed in ref. Some chondrocytes were stained strongly for proteoglycan immediately surrounding the cell and may represent the production of new proteoglycan in the time elapsed (12–13 h) since returning to normal gravity although glycosaminoglycan synthesis assays are needed to confirm this. Nine of the downregulated genes in spaceflight encode structural ECM components, including fibromodulin ( fmod ), osteoglycin ( Ogn ), osteomodulin ( Omd ), decorin ( Dcn ), dermatopontin ( Dpt ), PRELP ( Prelp ) collagen X ( Col10a1 ), thrombospondin4 ( Tsp4 ), and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( COMP )."
Host-microbe interactions in microgravity: assessment and implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187166/,"Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations. As humans move beyond our biosphere and undergo longer duration space flights, it will be essential to more fully understand microbial fitness in microgravity conditions in order to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans, plants and their respective microbiomes.","For example, if keystone microbes are lost in the host community, this may result in a shift in species diversity and richness of the microbiome, thus potentially facilitating the rise of opportunistic pathogens that might otherwise be contained by the normal microbial community. This adaptation can occur through horizontal gene transfer events, and recent sequencing evidence suggests that in humans, the microbiome is a hotspot for genetic transfer, facilitating the exchange of antibiotic resistance, food digestion and nutrient metabolism genes that may provide the microbe a competitive advantage within the host community [ 3 , 107 ]. Understanding the nature and frequency of such events, as well as the overall stability of the microbiome under microgravity conditions, will not only help elucidate how microgravity alters this dynamic microbial landscape but will help enable the formation of new strategies for maintenance and potential restoration of the healthy microbiome during spaceflight."
Environmental cues and symbiont microbe-associated molecular patterns function in concert to drive the daily remodelling of the crypt-cell brush border of the Euprymna scolopes light organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5219934/,"Summary Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush border. Together these occur on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. In contrast, symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the regulation of brush-border microarchitecture.","Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush border.

Symbiotic organs shaped by distinct modes of genome evolution in cephalopods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6386654/,"Significance Animal–microbe associations are critical drivers of evolutionary innovation, yet the origin of specialized symbiotic organs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the genome of Euprymna scolopes , a model cephalopod, and observed large-scale genomic reorganizations compared with the ancestral bilaterian genome. Alternatively, the ANG was enriched in novel, species-specific orphan genes suggesting these two tissues originated via different evolutionary strategies. These analyses represent the first genomic insights into the evolution of multiple symbiotic organs within a single animal host.","These paralog ages are consistent with a scenario in which the ANG and LO, which harbor dense populations of bacteria, underwent relatively recent innovations within the bobtail squid lineage through gene duplication, compared with the more ancient duplications of genes that are involved in development and function of cephalopod eyes and the nervous system. The ANG is a secretory organ within the female reproductive system containing a bacterial consortium that is deposited into the egg capsule and is believed to play a role in defense from fouling and/or pathogens during embryogenesis ( 7 , 8 , 15 , 16 ). scolopes (LO and ANG), we profiled protein-coding transcripts that mapped to genome scaffolds from tissue-specific transcriptomes against the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s nonredundant database [using BLASTP (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool - Protein) e-value threshold of 1E-5; Fig."
Modeled microgravity alters lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane vesicle production of the beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7940393/,"Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.","For example, in previous studies using the hindlimb unloading rodent model, a well-established method to simulate musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight 57 , 58 , results indicated that both LPS and the associated host-derived lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were elevated in rodent serum under hindlimb unloading 56 . Together, these results show that symbiotic microbes display significant physiological changes under modeled microgravity conditions, leading to a change in release of MAMPs known to affect host biology, which may have implications on host–microbe interactions. This dissociated response in the host animal under LSMMG suggests microgravity may alter the content of the OMVs, or that the host may be responding differently to these bacterial-derived signals under microgravity, despite the lack of differences observed in the extent of LPS-induced cell death between LSMMG and gravity controls (Supplementary Fig."
Emergence of novel cephalopod gene regulation and expression through large-scale genome reorganization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9023564/,"Abstract Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) have the largest nervous system among invertebrates that together with many lineage-specific morphological traits enables complex behaviors. Using comparative and functional genomics in the model squid Euprymna scolopes , we reveal the unique genomic, topological, and regulatory organization of cephalopod genomes. We show that coleoid cephalopod genomes have been extensively restructured compared to other animals, leading to the emergence of hundreds of tightly linked and evolutionary unique gene clusters (microsyntenies). We posit that the emergence of MACIs was instrumental to cephalopod nervous system evolution and propose that microsyntenic profiling will be central to understanding cephalopod innovations.","Taken together, the strong genomic conservation among sequenced cephalopods, the comparably tight packaging (short inter-gene distances) of microsyntenic clusters and their prevalent association with defined subcompartments within detected TADs suggests strong selective pressure to maintain regulatory properties of novel microsyntenic units in the cephalopod genomes. Evolutionary scenarios for functional microsynteny emergence in cephalopods Conserved gene co-localization may be explained by regulatory regions within a neighboring gene, even though the function of the gene may be unrelated (the bystander scenario), together forming a genomic regulatory block (GRB) 4 , 5 , or via shared regulatory elements controlling the expression of all syntenic genes, resulting in higher co-expression 8 . This result indicates that, unlike more conserved microsyntenies, novel cephalopod microsyntenies are more similar to the GRB scenario, in particular the bystander model, in which putative enhancers are found within closely located (bystander) genes inside the same microsyntenic cluster and may potentially lack distal regulatory domains."
Modeled microgravity alters apoptotic gene expression and caspase activity in the squid-vibrio symbiosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9389742/,"One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of normal developmental pathways. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and the gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio fischeri, was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes. Results Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Modeled microgravity-associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.","scolopes harbors a rich network of genes involved in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic regulation; (ii) the presence of symbiotic bacteria and LSMMG-stress altered the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression; (iii) the normal, bacteria-induced apoptosis in the squid light organ is mediated in part by caspases that exhibit increased activity under LSMMG; and (iv) the LSMMG-associated increase of caspase activity can be pharmacologically mitigated with inhibitors. These results suggest that the increased caspase expression in LSMMG may lower the activation threshold of light organ apoptosis due to the increased availability of proenzymes, which closely parallels previous reports that the concentrations of pro-caspases-9 and -3 are key predictors of apoptotic susceptibility [ 60 ]. These results align with the previous finding that cathepsin L – a lysosomal, cysteine-dependent protease – also contributes to developmental cell death in symbiotic paralarvae [ 30 ], suggesting apoptosis in the host animals is mediated by a multi-faceted array of apoptosis-associated proteases that are triggered by both external and intrinsic signals."
In vitro generation of mechanically functional cartilage grafts based on adult human stem cells and 3D-woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) scaffolds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2824534/,"Abstract Three-dimensionally woven poly(ε-caprolactone)(PCL) scaffolds were combined with adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to engineer mechanically functional cartilage constructs in vitro .

Construct DNA, total collagen, and glyocosaminoglycans (GAG) increased in a manner dependent on time, culture vessel, and medium composition.","These effects would be expected to reduce relative PCL yarn movement and cross-sectional shape distortion during compressive testing and have a more pronounced effect during mechanical testing in the unconfined configuration ( i.e. , where scaffolds are not laterally constrained) than the confined configuration, thereby affecting E more than H A . Efficient hMSC seeding and cartilaginous matrix deposition were observed for loosely and tightly woven PCL scaffolds, and can be attributed to the combination of Matrigel ® -enhanced cell entrapment[ 25 ] and large, homogenously distributed pores in the scaffold ( i.e. in-plane pores of 250 to 1000 µm, Figure 1 ). Culture in an oscillating bioreactor yielded constructs with higher aggregate modulus, higher total collagen content, and more homogeneous tissue development, especially at the upper and lower surfaces than otherwise identical static cultures ( Figure 2 – Figure 4 )."
Chondrogenesis and mineralization during in vitro culture of human mesenchymal stem cells on three-dimensional woven scaffolds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991213/,"Abstract Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) woven poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα1)/Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and osteocalcin. Long-term culture of hMSC on 3D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered cartilage, and stiffer underlying scaffold.","For example, by providing different concentrations of oxygen and/or growth factors on the upper and lower surfaces of hMSC-based constructs, it may be feasible to maintain cartilaginous tissue on one side, while inducing bone formation on the opposite side. 24 In the present study, an increase in culture duration to 45 days was associated with a decrease in H A , an increase in k , and the formation of a thick tissue-like layer comprised of cells and ECM that extended beyond the confines of the scaffold in the chondrogenic group ( Table 2 and Fig. Thus, the mineralization pattern observed in these constructs may be analogous in some respects to processes that occur during endochondral ossification 31 , 32 Upregulation of the bone transcription factor Cbfα1/Runx2 in association with other bone markers ALP, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and osteocalcin ( Table 3 ) provided evidence of active cellular processes, although passive calcium deposition may also have occurred as in a recent study."

Spaceflight alters host-gut microbiota interactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11362537/,"Abstract The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis . Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility.","The commonalities between LAR and ISS mice groups and use of distinct metagenomic methodologies, 16 S rRNA gene barcoding and co-assembled WMS, helped provide some biological and technical confidence in the spaceflight-associated changes in microbiome species detected here; however, it is likely that low n reduced statistical power and that important microbiome associations were missed, particularly those of low abundance bacteria. It is important that the imminent commercial low Earth orbit destinations (CLDs), Gateway, and Lunar Base Camp increase the capacity of their experimental habitats and growth facilities to support replicate numbers for multiomic science, in order to maximise discoveries and enable future interventional microbiome studies. The addition of untargeted serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened this research and future studies should aim to quantitatively profile the specific deconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the system."
Asparagine biosynthesis as a mechanism of increased host lethality induced by Serratia marcescens in simulated microgravity environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9111996/,"Abstract While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S.","marcescens grown in LSMMG consume key amino acids glutamine and asparagine at a faster rate than the control ( Figure 1 C, D), suggesting that the LSMMG might be priming these pathogens to compete with responding host immune cells for extracellular amino acids necessary for proliferation. We see in our study that growth in LSMMG increases the expression of asnB ( Figure 1 B), implying an increased consumption of aspartate and glutamine to synthesize asparagine more efficiently, that may allow these pathogens to out-compete host immune cells for amino acids during infection. These results suggest that additional exogenous L-asparaginase has a detrimental effect on the pathogen itself and causes it to become less virulent in LSMMG, perhaps by reducing the amount of available asparagine that otherwise would have enhanced the LSMMG-treated microbe's ability to utilize this amino acid in the host's body."
Comparative genomic analysis of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. isolated from the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10308117/,"Abstract A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis , with the type strain F6_2S_P_1 T (=NRRL B-65657 T and DSMZ 115098 T ). ginsengisoli , along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C.","Strain F6_2S_P_1 T was the only genome in the genus Cohnella which a heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase was detected; these BGCs are used by cyanobacteria to compartmentalize N 2 fixation and are activated in low-nitrogen conditions (Campbell et al., 1997 ), but as strain F6_2S_P_1 T does not contain a full suite of genes for N 2 fixation and the cluster is not a strong match, it is likely a producer of some kind of potentially uncharacterized lipid compound. Enhanced HO-1 expression in plants and animals is also associated with stress response as the resulting biliverdin and bilirubin scavenge ROS species (Singh and Bhatla, 2022 ); the bacterial species Paenibacillus polymyxa applied as a probiotic induces increased intestinal HO-1 expression as part of its anti-oxidant effects on gut health in animals (Wu et al., 2019 ). α-L-rhamnosidase cleaves terminal α-rhamnose residues and in doing so helps concentrate and improve the action of flavonoids; α-L-rhamnosidase from different bacterial species is used for many industrial applications such as improving wine aroma, sweetening fruit juice, and increasing concentration and efficacy of antibiotic and anti-cancer compounds ( Xie et al., 2022 ) ."
Characterization of metagenome-assembled genomes from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10233975/,"Abstract Background Several investigations on the microbial diversity and functional properties of the International Space Station (ISS) environment were carried out to understand the influence of spaceflight conditions on the microbial population. However, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of ISS samples are yet to be generated and subjected to various genomic analyses, including phylogenetic affiliation, predicted functional pathways, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence characteristics. Results In total, 46 MAGs were assembled from 21 ISS environmental metagenomes, in which metaSPAdes yielded 20 MAGs and metaWRAP generated 26 MAGs. Among 46 MAGs retrieved, 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus/species combination ( Kalamiella piersonii ) and one novel bacterial species ( Methylobacterium ajmalii ). MAGs were further used to analyze if genes involved in AMR and biofilm formation of viable microbes in ISS have variation due to generational evolution in microgravity and radiation pressure.","Metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes Out of the 42 ISS metagenomes submitted at NCBI, only PMA-treated metagenomes ( n = 21) representing the viable/intact cells were used for generating bacterial MAGs. Characteristics of MAGs ( n = 46) such as genome size (2.6 to 6.6 Mb), completeness, contamination percentage, the average mean coverage, number of scaffolds, and N50 (5 to 670 Kb) were calculated using CheckM, and assembly statistics are summarized in Table 1 . Differential characteristics of biofilm and quorum sensing-related genes in ISS Enterobacter bungandensis ( n = 4) and F1-2P MAG ( n = 1) when compared to other related strains Open in a new tab NA indicates that the FASTA data for that gene in that specific strain was not found in any database These SNPs analysis results were also supportive of the function of the genes, e.g., the AI-luxS gene had nucleotide mutations; however, none of these nucleotide mutations led to a change of amino acid. In that regard, environmental stress would have no effect on that gene since a change in the gene sequence would not serve to increase the rate of biofilm production and increase the overall amount of biofilm formed, but we can also see that there is a decent amount of amino acid change in the LsrC gene which is responsible for importing the autoinducer, and this makes sense because while the autoinducer itself does not need to be changed, the rate at which it is imported to carry information needs to be increased or reduced to accommodate for the change in the amount of biofilm produced."
Biocontrol in built environments to reduce pathogen exposure and infection risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10848226/,"These have informed in vitro studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.","These experiments will require highly controlled and easily manipulatable conditions, and therefore, laboratory testing will be essential for determining the relative importance of factors associated with method of use, humidity, nutrient availability, surface material type, and cleaning regimes. As seen in studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, harsh cleaning treatments using bleach may inhibit the probiotic and phage cleaners, so it will be imperative that staff are trained in how to properly treat surfaces cleaned with probiotics. Establishing the efficacy of these products through well-designed field intervention studies that are informed by lab-based experiments is an exciting subfield of built environment microbiome research and will ultimately lead to better products, building materials, and design techniques in buildings to improve occupant health and well-being."
Extracellular nucleotides elicit cytosolic free calcium oscillations in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329368/,"Abstract Extracellular purine nucleotides appear capable of regulating plant development, defence and stress responses by acting in part as agonists of plasma membrane calcium channels. Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant. This confirms that ADP could elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species.","[Conclusion Not Found; Full Article Summary]: doi: 10.4161/psb.6.11.17014 Release of extracellular purines from plant roots and effect on ion fluxes Adeeba Dark Adeeba Dark 1 Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge; Cambridge, UK Find articles by Adeeba Dark 1 , Vadim Demidchik Vadim Demidchik 2 Department of Biology, University of Essex; Colchester, UK Find articles by Vadim Demidchik 2 , Siân L Richards Siân L Richards 1 Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge; Cambridge, UK Find articles by Siân L Richards 1 , Sergey Shabala Sergey Shabala 3 School of Agricultural Sciences, University of Tasmania; Hobart; Australia Find articles by Sergey Shabala 3 , Julia M Davies Julia M Davies 1 Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge; Cambridge, UK Find articles by Julia M Davies 1, * Author information Copyright and License information 1 Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge; Cambridge, UK 2 Department of Biology, University of Essex; Colchester, UK 3 School of Agricultural Sciences, University of Tasmania; Hobart; Australia * Correspondence to: Julia M.

"Calcium, mechanical signaling, and tip growth",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12008199/,"Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling.

"Salt stress-induced Ca2+ waves are associated with rapid, long-distance root-to-shoot signaling in plants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035928/,"Significance This work documents a previously unreported plant-wide signaling system based on the rapid, long-distance transmission of Ca 2+ waves. In the root these waves move through the cortical and endodermal cell layers at speeds of up to 400 µm/s, i.e., traversing several cells per second. This Ca 2+ wave system correlates with the triggering of molecular responses in distant parts of the plant upon perception of localized (salt) stress. Such propagating Ca 2+ waves provide a new mechanism for the rapid integration of activities throughout the plant body.","In plants, environmental stimuli including wounding or heat stress have been proposed to elicit long-distance signaling involving mechanisms such as plasma membrane depolarization and self-propagating increases of ROS ( 1 – 5 , 21 , 22 ). Thus, these patterns of transmission and response are consistent with a model in which the rapidly propagating Ca 2+ wave serves as a long-distance signal that triggers systemic responses to local salt stress of the root system. Furthermore, comparison of WT, tpc1-2 , and plants overexpressing TPC1 grown on 100 mM NaCl-containing plates indicated that, by 7 d, the overexpression line was significantly more resistant to this level of salt stress as inferred from plant size and chlorophyll content ( Fig."

Wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion enhances amyloplast dynamics in Arabidopsis zigzag1 hypocotyls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5181587/,"Highlight The highly restricted movement of amyloplasts in graviperceptive cells of zig-1 hypocotyls is overcome by wortmannin treatment, suggesting a physical association between amyloplasts and the vacuole.

The alternate possibility that Wm is actually affecting gravitropism through effects on cellular events unrelated to vacuolar function seems less likely as Wm action on gravity response is not seen in WT plants where these other sites of action would presumably still be present. Visualization of endodermal cells in the medial region of the hypocotyl of etiolated seedlings indicated that most cells did not show the expected sedimented amyloplasts, and instead these organelles were in constant motion from cytoplasmic streaming."
A ROS-assisted calcium wave dependent on AtRBOHD and TPC1 propagates the systemic response to salt stress in Arabidopsis roots,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936552/,Mathematical modeling coupled with direct measurement of Ca 2+ and ROS dynamics suggest that ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium release propagates stress-induced Ca 2+ waves in plants.,"The knockout of TPC1 that slows Ca 2+ wave transmission approximately 40-fold only delays the Ca 2+ response at the site of direct NaCl treatment by 30 s ( Choi et al., 2014 ), suggesting that TPC1 may have a more pronounced role in transmission than in the initial direct stress response, consistent with the lack of an obvious Ca 2+ dynamics phenotype in response to stress in tpc1-2 when measured at the whole-plant level ( Ranf et al., 2008 ). ROS -sensitive Ca 2+ channel activities have been monitored at the electrophysiological level in Arabidopsis root cells ( Foreman et al., 2003 ; Demidchik and Maathuis, 2007 ; Ordoñez et al., 2014 ), and ROS -responsive candidates such as the annexins ( Richards et al., 2014 ) have been identified at the molecular level, although their possible roles in Ca 2+ wave transmission remain to be explored. A TPC1-mediated CICR wave acting alone seems unlikely, and that motivated us to look at ROS propagation, but the requirement for a ROS -activated plasma membrane Ca 2+ channel means there also could be sources of Ca 2+ influx within the plasmodesmatal plasma membrane itself that could contribute to a rapid transmission event."
"ROS, calcium and electric signals: Key mediators of rapid systemic signaling in plants",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7610290/,The reactive oxygen species wave propagates through vascular bundles during the systemic response of Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) plants to excess light stress.,"A perpetual cell-to-cell process of ROS-induced ROS production, that is, the ROS wave, propagates from a local tissue subjected to stress to the entire plant and is required for the induction of different acclimation transcripts, metabolites, and physiological responses in systemic tissues that results in SAA of systemic tissues to stress ( Miller et al., 2009 ; Mittler et al., 2011 ; Choudhury et al., 2018 ; Devireddy et al., 2018 , 2020 ; Kollist et al., 2019 ; Zandalinas et al., 2019 , 2020 ; Fichman and Mittler, 2020 ). RBOH-dependent ROS production in response to light stress was recently reported in bundle sheath strands of rice ( Oryza sativa ; Xiong et al., 2020 ), further supporting our findings that ROS-mediated signaling at the vascular bundles or veins of plants plays a key role in systemic responses to light stress ( Figures 1 to 5 ). Because hydraulic waves are also thought to propagate through the vascular bundles ( Sade et al., 2014 ; Gilroy et al., 2016 ; Choi et al., 2017 ; Fichman and Mittler, 2020 ), our findings that RBOHD expression in xylem parenchyma or phloem is sufficient to restore whole-plant systemic ROS signaling could further suggest that the ROS, calcium, electric, and hydraulic waves are all integrated in these tissues."
Real-time In Vivo Recording of Arabidopsis Calcium Signals During Insect Feeding Using a Fluorescent Biosensor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614317/,"Abstract Calcium ions are predicted to be key signaling entities during biotic interactions, with calcium signaling forming an established part of the plant defense response to microbial elicitors and to wounding caused by chewing insects, eliciting systemic calcium signals in plants. Hemipterans such as aphids pierce a small number of cells with specialized, elongated sucking mouthparts, making them the ideal tool to study calcium dynamics when a plant is faced with a biotic stress, which is distinct from a wounding response. Expressing a GFP-based calcium biosensor, GCaMP3, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the real-time imaging of plant calcium dynamics during insect feeding, with a high spatial and temporal resolution. The protocol can be adapted to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, while the use of Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the rapid generation of mutants to facilitate the molecular analysis of the phenomenon.","In addition, the use of a stereomicroscope allows for the imaging of entire leaves, which is essential given that many biotic interactions, including plant-aphid interactions, occur on a large spatial scale. Other conditions that alter the fluorescent properties of the individual fluorophores are unlikely to mimic the opposing changes in intensity of CFP and YFP, and the ratiometric calculation that is used inherently normalizes the measurements for many of these other optical artifacts 23 , 30 . Importantly, single-FP biosensors typically display a greater fluorescent yield and greater dynamic range ( i.e., an increase in florescence upon Ca 2+ binding) than FRET Cameleons 23 , which makes GCaMP more suited to tissue-level imaging, while FRET Cameleons are a useful tool for cellular imaging with a confocal microscope 5 , 25 ."
"Orchestrating rapid long-distance signaling in plants with Ca2+ , ROS, and electrical signals",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5677518/,"SUMMARY Plants show a rapid systemic response to a wide range of environmental stresses, where the signals from the site of stimulus perception are transmitted to distal organs to elicit plant-wide responses. A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca 2+ and electrical signaling (‘trio signaling’) appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. The plant cell wall presents a plant-specific route for possible propagation of signals from cell to cell. However, the degree to which the cell wall limits information exchange between cells via transfer of small molecules through an extracellular route, or whether it provides an environment to facilitate transmission of regulators such as ROS or H + remains to be determined.","A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca 2+ and electrical signaling (‘trio signaling’) appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission.

"Glutamate triggers long-distance, calcium-based plant defense signaling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11850895/,"Abstract Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability, whereas plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have evolved systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that trigger long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with environmental challenges. Here, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library identifies a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously defined wound signal essential for activating plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibits attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncover GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling events in plants. Our findings offer new insights into highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against herbivory and pathogen invasion.","Interestingly, as shown in our transcriptome data, in addition to the pronounced enrichment of genes associated with JA signaling in systemic leaf tissues after GSH treatment, genes responsive to other defense phytohormones such as ethylene and salicylic acid, which are responsible for plant resistance to pathogen infection, are also highly upregulated (Supplementary Data 1 ), implying that GSH might also act as a signaling molecule to activate the plant systemic immune response. Considering the recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, which revealed that GSH and Glu could bind to different domains of GLR3.4 for ion channel activation 30 , it would be intriguing to investigate whether GSH binds to GLR3.3 and further determine the potential relationship between GSH and Glu in activating GLR3.3. Furthermore, in contrast to GSH and Glu, the recently identified Ricca’s factor TGGs, was shown to rely on both GLR3.6 and GLR3.3 to trigger the systemic defense response 6 . Given that various chemical substances have been identified as neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in mammals, eliciting long-distance ionic responses that effectively mediate neurotransmission, identification of more systematic signaling molecules in the future would offer new insights into the complex systemic defense signaling in plants."
Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome: A discovery environment to explore multiple plant biology spaceflight experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7076552/,"Abstract Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments.","As the volume of spaceflight omics-level data increases, its power will lie in researchers' ability to mine both within and across multiple datasets. The TOAST database has been released as a publicly available, web-based environment ( https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast ) along with an online tutorial at https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast/tutorial-metadata . However, the underlying TOAST architecture is biological kingdom agnostic; through use of orthologous matrix mapping, we are working to extend TOAST to facilitate similar data exploration across the wealth of biological systems that are being analyzed in spaceflight."
Tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps regulate Ca2+ signals during pattern-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7414185/,"Significance Ca 2+ signaling is closely linked to the triggering of plant immune responses. We show that when the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants missing tonoplast Ca 2+ pumps, it causes disrupted Ca 2+ signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca 2+ pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast pump knockout mutant’s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca 2+ signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca 2+ dynamics in innate immune responses but that any regulatory systems specific to the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support these signaling events.","Elevated temperature is known to attenuate defense signaling ( 27 ) and as the aca4/11 plants show phenotypes pointing at runaway PTI events (lesion mimicry, elevated defense responses, increased Ca 2+ signaling to flg22), we used this treatment to ask if the high-temperature effect suppressed both Ca 2+ dynamics and other defense-response phenotypes. Although previous studies have indicated that PTI responses, including positive regulation of defense transcripts and MAPK activation, are favored at elevated temperatures ( 41 ), our experiments indicate that Ca 2+ signaling, a canonic PTI response, is suppressed at elevated temperature, consistent with reports that defense-response systems are compromised at higher temperatures, likely through alterations in salicylic acid-dependent pathways ( 29 ). Although specific regulatory events associated with each membrane locale may have evolved, the basic core pumping activity of these transporters appears robust enough to work in varied cellular locations."
The fast and the furious: Rapid long-range signaling in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8133610/,"In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu.","We are now finding similar kinds of rapid, systemic signaling systems in a wide variety of plants operating in response to stimuli ranging from the leaf wounding caused by insect herbivory to local high-light stress. Although APs and VPs are intimately linked to plasma membrane-related events, reflecting as they do ion movements across this membrane, the important roles of the vacuolar ion channel TPC1 and the potential for GLRs located on intracellular membranes such as the tonoplast and ER in systemic signaling highlight the likely role of organelles in propagating these events. Despite some major advances in defining molecular mechanisms in the last few years, our models of these systemic signaling events are clearly still far from complete (see Outstanding Questions)."
Rad-Bio-App: A discovery environment for biologists to explore spaceflight-related radiation exposures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8113475/,"For example, in space, organisms experience ionizing radiation environments that significantly differ in both quality and quantity from those normally experienced on Earth. However, data on radiation exposure during space missions is often complex to access and to understand, limiting progress towards defining how radiation affects organisms against the unique background of spaceflight. This web-accessible database imports radiation metadata from experiments archived in NASA’s GeneLab data repository, and then allows the user to explore these experiments both in the context of their radiation exposure and through their other metadata and results. Rad-Bio-App provides an easy-to-use, graphically-driven environment to enable both radiation biologists and non-specialist researchers to visualize, and understand the impact of ionizing radiation on various biological systems in the context of spaceflight.","To conclude, we have introduced a data mining visualization tool, the Rad-Bio-App, enabling the rapid identification of omics datasets deposited in the NASA GeneLab data repository, which are relevant for a specific spaceflight radiation scenario (e.g., trip to Mars or on the lunar surface) or specific characteristics of radiation exposure. Because the Rad-Bio-App links to GeneLab datasets, it was then straightforward to extract processed gene expression tables from GeneLab to identify common pathways that may be modified by, in this case, the lunar surface radiation environment. As more researchers enter datasets into GeneLab related to spaceflight and radiation exposure that explore the effects of e.g., species, genetics, gender, and age, the Rad-Bio-App should become an increasingly powerful tool to help accelerate assessment of the effects of Space radiation environments on living entities."
The vacuolar H+/Ca transporter CAX1 participates in submergence and anoxia stress responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9706465/,"Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified cax1 -mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that cax1 anoxia response pathway could be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair production agriculture.","Our work suggests that cax1 has numerous adaptations to endure anoxia stress ( Figure 8 ): (1) The plant is primed for anoxia through altered expression of ROS, HRGs, and temperature perception genes ( Figures 4 and 5 ; Supplemental Figures S6 and S13 and Supplemental Table S20 ); (2) During anoxia, changes in light and carbohydrate metabolism may mitigate the stress ( Figures 5 and 6 ); (3) Post anoxia, altered Ca signaling could help dissipate the reoxygenation stress ( Figure 7 ). The loss of high-capacity low-affinity Ca transport caused by disruption of CAX1 led to numerous changes in gene expression and protein abundance; the breadth of these changes makes the identification of a single causative pathway for this submergence/anoxia tolerance a challenging endeavor. Heat shock response involves the induction of a wide range of molecular chaperones to aid in protecting and refolding damaged proteins and so this constitutive production of, for example heat shock proteins may equip cax1 with readymade machinery to cope with some of the cellular damage that anoxia and reoxygenation imposes."
Meta-analysis of the space flight and microgravity response of the Arabidopsis plant transcriptome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10027818/,"Abstract Spaceflight presents a multifaceted environment for plants, combining the effects on growth of many stressors and factors including altered gravity, the influence of experiment hardware, and increased radiation exposure. To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to spaceflight.","Although originally identified as a cold induced transcript, COR78 is now known to be highly inducible in response to a range of abiotic factors ranging from wounding and salt exposure to osmotic stress, drought and even the hypobaric (low pressure) environments predicted for future large scale, space-based plant growth facilities 39 – 41 . In this work we focused on two elements to highlight the potential of this approach: (1) making broad comparisons across the entire sets of data to draw conclusions about confounding variables that likely superimpose differences on spaceflight datasets, and (2) making analyses focusing on the commonly used BRIC hardware to help researchers understand the possibilities offered by designing comparative analyses in the context of the Matrix metadata. From the Matrix-driven exploration presented here, we found that: (1) comparisons across different transcriptome monitoring technologies (RNA-seq versus microarray) should be performed with great care as differences in the technology used can impose greater variation on results than the biological treatment (spaceflight versus ground control); (2) environmental conditions and hardware-related constraints in the experimental design produce smaller but also important differences that can confound interpretation of the spaceflight versus ground control comparisons; (3) when these factors are controlled for, comparisons across the breadth of spaceflight-related Arabidopsis experiments reveal alterations in general responses to environmental stresses, photosynthesis, and other elements of primary and secondary metabolism (Fig."
"Low-dose, ionizing radiation and age-related changes in skeletal microarchitecture",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3337602/,"Abstract Osteoporosis can profoundly affect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated (total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy 137 Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. In conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural changes normally found during progressive, postpubertal aging prior to the onset of age-related osteoporosis.","These data are consistent with previous studies that monitored radiation and aging effects [ 3 , 4 ] and show that normal accrual of body mass, as a broad measure of health over time at this age, was unimpeded by exposure to gamma irradiation with these doses. In previous studies that used older mice (16 weeks of age), 100 cGy caused bone loss in the tibia via reduced trabecular thickness, but not trabecular number, with the onset of osteopenia appearing 10 days after-irradiation [ 15 ]. Microarchitectural changes following irradiation observed in this study resembled the effects of a larger dose in older, male mice (16 weeks, 200 cGy) within the lumbar spine (a denser, plate-like cancellous tissue) [ 15 ] and in the tibia (unpublished results), where gamma irradiation at 200 cGy caused vertebral and tibial bone loss via trabecular number and connectivity density decrements appearing within 3 days and persisting at least until 30 days after-irradiation."
Ionizing Radiation Stimulates Expression of Pro-Osteoclastogenic Genes in Marrow and Skeletal Tissue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4490751/,"To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( Rankl ), within marrow cells over controls. Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.","Furthermore, a dose threshold was observed, as 5 cGy iron exposure failed to elicit changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow or cancellous bone structure (data not shown); these findings provide additional indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that early induction of osteoclastogenic cytokine gene expression by biologically effective doses of radiation leads to cancellous bone loss. Together, the results demonstrate that radiation-induced structural changes were associated with a marrow environment favoring stimulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity by Rankl and other inflammation-related cytokines as follows: Radiation increased gene expression levels for pro-osteoclastogenic signaling molecules ( Csf1 , Rankl , Tnf ), as well as a trend toward increasing antiosteoclastogenic molecules ( Opg ), in the marrow and mineralized tissue of irradiated mice compared with sham controls. Taken together, these data lead us to propose a 2-stage process for radiation-induced osteoclastogenesis: first, radiation-induced gene expression of osteoclastogenic cytokines leads to enrichment of the marrow with osteoclast precursors (monocyte–macrophage, myeloid lineage cells) and drives differentiation into osteoclasts, and, second, that inflammation-related cytokines co-stimulate differentiating and mature osteoclasts."
Preservation of Multiple Mammalian Tissues to Maximize Science Return from Ground Based and Spaceflight Experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5132293/,"Abstract Background Even with recent scientific advancements, challenges posed by limited resources and capabilities at the time of sample dissection continue to limit the collection of high quality tissues from experiments that can be conducted only infrequently and at high cost, such as in space. The resources and time it takes to harvest tissues post-euthanasia, and the methods and duration of long duration storage, potentially have negative impacts on sample quantity and quality, thereby limiting the scientific outcome that can be achieved. The first objective was to determine the impacts of tissue harvest time post-euthanasia, preservation methods, and storage duration, focusing on RNA quality and enzyme activities in liver and spleen as indices of sample quality. Conclusion These results demonstrate that 1) the protocols developed for spaceflight experiments with on-orbit dissections support the retrieval of high quality samples for RNA expression and some protein analyses, despite delayed preservation post-euthanasia or prolonged storage, and 2) many additional tissues for gene expression analysis can be obtained by dissection even following prolonged storage of the tissue in situ at -80°C.","However, RNA samples isolated from select tissues dissected from frozen carcasses (e.g. spleen, small intestine, bone marrow and mineralized tissues) showed degradation even with short duration storage, probably due to high endogenous RNase activity. Furthermore, it was reported that RNA with low RIN still allows for reliable monitoring of mRNA expression by qPCR if small amplicon sizes are targeted, although large amplicons failed to generate measurable expression values [ 25 ]. Spleens and livers collected at various time points post-euthanasia to simulate challenging conditions for dissections in microgravity yielded samples with high RIN values, thus anticipating return of samples with high quality from space even if preservation post-euthanasia is delayed up to 1 hour."
Hindlimb Unloading: Rodent Analog for Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11747068/,"Methods Firstly, we leveraged scRNA-seq to perform clustering analysis to identify diverse cell populations and sub-clusters within CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of hindlimb unloading. At last, the TF network analysis was performed using the SCENIC R package to predict the pivotal TFs in rat artery remodeling induced by hindlimb unloading. Intersection of dysregulated genes specific for artery type and cell type after tail suspension revealed several gene sets involved in ECM remodeling, inflammation, vasoconstriction, etc. Conclusions This study presents the first cellular atlas of the conductive arteries in hindlimb-unloaded rats, revealing a spectrum of dysregulated gene profiles.","Moreover, the upregulation of inflammation-related TFs ( Klf4 , Fos , Jun , Cebpb ) across several cell types, the upregulation of Cxcr4 in HU-CA and HU-FA macrophages, and heightened Txnip expression in fibroblasts collectively suggest a possible inflammatory state in the circulatory system of hindlimb-unweighted rats. Additionally, the downregulation of these genes associated with elastic fibers ( Eln ), collagens ( Col1a1 , Col3a1 ), and other ECM components ( Lox , Sparc ) in the CA and FA of hindlimb-unweighted rats may partially explain the observed decrease in vascular distensibility and the increased vascular stiffness reported previously [ 2 ]. Moreover, we found a sub-cluster of SMCs responsible for DNA replication and mitosis, indicating the highly proliferative activity of this sub-cluster of SMCs. As adjacent component of blood vessels, ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts can communicate with each other through direct contact, paracrine and extracellular vesicles [ 66 ]."
Redox Signaling and Its Impact on Skeletal and Vascular Responses to Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666834/,"The purpose of this review is to describe current understanding of microgravity and radiation impacts on the mammalian skeleton and associated vasculature at the level of the whole organism. Recent experiments from spaceflight and ground-based models have provided fresh insights into how these environmental stresses influence mechanisms that are related to redox signaling, oxidative stress, and tissue dysfunction. Emerging mechanistic knowledge on cellular defenses to radiation and other environmental stressors, including microgravity, are useful for both screening and developing interventions against spaceflight-induced deficits in bone and vascular function. Keywords: spaceflight, bone, vasculature, oxidative stress, microgravity, hindlimb unloading, radiation, reactive oxygen species, antioxidant","[Conclusion Not Found; Full Article Summary]: The downregulation of antioxidant defenses as a potential mechanism for the increased levels of oxidative damage post-flight is supported by the observation that hair follicle samples from International Space Station (ISS) crew members at post-flight display decreased expression of endogenous antioxidant genes, including Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), CuZnSOD, glutathione peroxidase 4 ( GPX4 ) and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 ( KEAP1 ), the regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( NFE2L2 a.k.a. NRF2 ), a master transcription factor that regulates hundreds of oxidative defense-related genes [ 24 ]. Furthermore, bone marrow from rodents exposed to radiation display increased expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 ( IL6 ), tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP1 ), and the pro-osteoclastogenic signal, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( RANKL ), as well as upregulation of NRF2 [ 34 , 35 ]. Within a period of three days to a month, relatively low doses of radiation (≤2 Gy) lead to progressive loss of cancellous bone, as shown by our group and others [ 34 , 35 , 141 , 142 , 143 , 144 ], which is preceeded by a rapid increase in expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL1 and TNFα and pro-osteoclastogenic signals RANKL and MCP1 as well as the oxidative defense gene, NRF2 [ 34 , 35 ]. The hypothesis was tested by evaluating a number of candidate interventions including: (1) an antioxidant diet cocktail (AOX) composed of N -acetyl cysteine, ascorbic acid, l -selenomethionine, dihydrolipoic acid and vitamin E which in combination has been shown to protect a variety of tissues from ionizing radiation [ 145 , 146 , 147 ]; (2) dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), which possesses antioxidant properties [ 148 , 149 ]; (3) the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Ibuprofen [ 150 , 151 ]; and (4) Dried Plum (DP, 25% by weight), previously reported to inhibit osteoclast activity and protect from age-related bone loss [ 152 , 153 , 154 , 155 ].

Influence of social isolation during prolonged simulated weightlessness by hindlimb unloading,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6753329/,"Abstract The hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. Keywords: hindlimb unloading, microgravity model, bone loss, muscle atrophy, immune system, spaceflight, social isolation, HPA axis","Furthermore, the spleen also can accommodate fluid pressure shifts by widening or narrowing internal splenic blood vessels in response to signaling atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) from cardiac myocytes ( Kaufman, 1992 ; Sultanian et al., 2001 ; Kaufman and Levasseur, 2003 ), which may serve an important role during microgravity-related fluid pressure shifts. We found that deficits in muscle and bone microarchitecture observed in HU mice were fundamentally a response to changes in gravitational loading (i.e., hindquarter disuse and fluid shifts) while components of the immune system and HPA axis were differentially impacted by the social environment during HU. The availability of both single and social housing HU models can facilitate studies that aim to distinguish the effects of social interactions on the HPA axis and immune system, thereby expanding the utility of the HU model for studying how the spaceflight environment impacts organ systems."
Validation of a new Rodent experimental System to investigate consequences of Long Duration Space Habitation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7012842/,"Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth.

Thus, this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering standard indices of chronic stress.","The main objective of this work was to develop new capability for conducting long duration, rodent experiments in space which both minimize the complications of non-specific, chronic stress responses and allow for sample recovery on-orbit, thereby avoiding the confounding variables associated with returning to Earth. Early, short duration rat spaceflight experiments showed that spaceflight increased hepatic lipid peroxidation, altered enzyme protein levels 40 , 41 , and together with later studies, led to the proposal that spaceflight leads to pathological changes consistent with the eventual development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with long duration spaceflight 39 . Taken together, findings from the liver tissue indicate that both methods of spaceflight tissue preservation were sufficient to yield RNA with RIN values generally considered adequate for most molecular analyses although possible differences in patterns of gene expression assessed by RTqPCR require further evaluation to determine if recovery from frozen carcasses yields unreliable results, perhaps due to warm ischemia 47 in liver samples recovered from the carcasses (Supplementary Fig."
Skeletal tissue regulation by catalase over-expression in mitochondria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4405755/,"SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H 2 O 2 accumulation and no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. PGC-α overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.","Although several studies have attempted to elucidate the signalling pathways involved in triggering atrophy during disuse of limb muscles, the exact mechanisms responsible for disuse-induced muscular atrophy are currently debated and there is still no therapy to treat muscle atrophy. Specifically, the authors found that the initial unloading phase was associated with increased repression of 4EBP1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1) on translation initiation factor eIF4E without alteration of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/S6 pathway, while prolonged disuse (14 days) was associated with activation of translational signalling, including activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/S6 pathway and diminished repression of 4EBP1 on eIF4E. The findings discussed so far prompted the hypothesis that in fast muscles an early down-regulation of pro-fusion proteins at 3 days of HU, through concomitant AMPK activation, can activate the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and autophagy, and ultimately cause muscle mass loss in disuse."
Overexpression of catalase in mitochondria mitigates changes in hippocampal cytokine expression following simulated microgravity and isolation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260663/,"Abstract Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system.

An extensive allelic series of Drosophila kae1 mutants reveals diverse and tissue-specific requirements for t6A biogenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647464/,"kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1 , whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease.","Moreover, we demonstrate substantial cross-species rescue by fly Kae1 (and its partners) in yeast kae1 mutants, both in terms of growth capacity and in recovery of t6A-modified tRNAs. While this work was in preparation, similar observations using the kae1 transposon insertion alleles were reported by the Glavic group ( Rojas-Benitez et al. In this scenario, even though we assayed timepoints going well past the established range of maternal effects (e.g., up to 18 d, or the equivalent of a week-old adult fly), those modified tRNAs that were maternally deposited or generated from maternal kae1 mRNA and/or protein persisted all that time. Phenotypes common to loss of Kae1 and SUMO include extended larval phases before lethality, presence of melanotic tumors, and preferential defects in mitotic versus nonproliferating cells, as evidenced by their lack of imaginal discs while retaining diverse other larval tissues ( Kalamarz et al."

A combined computational strategy of sequence and structural analysis predicts the existence of a functional eicosanoid pathway in Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6372189/,"Abstract This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been identified. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics.","In the vertebrate pathway, the 18-carbon fatty acids linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid can be processed into the 20-carbon PUFAs arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, respectively, via a three-step process involving a Δ6 desaturase, an elongase, and, a Δ5 desaturase. According to previous studies Drosophila appear to lack homologs for the mammalian Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases based upon sequence analyses, and so it should be unable to synthesize 20–22 carbon PUFAs from essential fatty acid precursors [ 112 ]. melanogaster lacks Δ5 and Δ6 desaturase activity, it would be expected that the 18-carbon PUFAs obtained from its diet are processed into HODEs as opposed to eicosanoid derivatives of the 20-carbon PUFAs. Recent studies have validated this hypothesis, and confirmed the presence of 9- and 13-HODEs in D ."

Spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions increase virulence of Serratia marcescens in the Drosophila melanogaster infection model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000411/,"Abstract While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll , suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.","52 Similarly in our study with ground-reared fly host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with spaceflight-exposed Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 1 ) as well as in vivo, the current results indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following infection of bacteria altered by spaceflight and LSMMG are likely due to changes to the pathogen, rather than a difference in host immune response of ground-reared flies. This suggests that bacteria growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between spaceflight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not find significant changes in host immune-related genes after infection with spaceflight sample compared to ground sample in wild-type ground-reared flies (Fig."
A parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its host's blood cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191917/,"EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila . Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.","To overcome the resistance of their hosts, parasitic wasps use varied and ingenious strategies such as mimicry, evasion, bioactive venom, virus-like particles, viruses, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). We describe the effects of a unique class of EVs containing virulence proteins and produced in the venom of wasps that parasitize fruit flies of Drosophila species. An important protein in this process, Rab5, is needed to maintain the identity of the macrophage; when Rab5 function is reduced, macrophages turn into a different cell type called lamellocytes."

The CPC clip motif of heparin-binding proteins is considered to be the minimum required motif for heparin-binding affinity and is defined by specific spatial relationships between three residues, two cationic (Arg/Lys) and one polar (Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, Tyr). Thus, it is possible that a CPC clip containing LhKNOT and Drosomycin (and possibly other fly AMPs, such as Defensin [ 63 ]) can modulate immune signaling (and/or binding to the pathogen’s virulence proteins), similarly affecting the bacterial pathogen/metazoan parasite outcome."

Simultaneous exposure of cultured human lymphoblastic cells to simulated microgravity and radiation increases chromosome aberrations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555395/,"For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated μ G on the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to μ G . However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated μ G conditions. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1 G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts’ potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer.","Although damages caused by high-LET exposure were expected to different form damages induced by low-LET exposure, we applied this modified formula in many cases of single-mono energetic ion beams in various LET, as well as mixed beam [ 33 , 37 , 38 ], and the results were in good agreement with the CA frequencies simulated by Monte Carlo modeling both single beam and mixed beams [ 39 , 40 , 41 ]. Monte Carlo simulations as well as various other experiments indicate that complex DNA lesions with multiple damage sites, including double strand breaks, single strand breaks, and other damages within one or two helical turns referred to as clustered DNA damage are caused by heavy ion irradiation [ 56 , 57 ]. Since clustered DNA breaks are difficult to correctly repair, breaks made by heavy ion irradiation are more likely to cause CAs.

Genes required for survival in microgravity revealed by genome-wide yeast deletion collections cultured during spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309212/,"We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.","Based on a wealth of published data [ 14 , 15 ], the homozygous, nonessential deletion collection tends to reveal a similar set of genes involved in pathways required for resistance to/survival in multiple environmental conditions, whereas the heterozygous collection of all strains tends to be more specific, identifying essential proteins uniquely required for growth in a specific condition [ 13 ]. For the homozygous deletion collection, strains that were depleted from the pool specifically in spaceflight conditions are significantly enriched for genes in biological processes related to different aspects of RNA metabolism and catabolism, including ribosome biogenesis, regulation of ribosomal protein transcription, cytoplasmic RNA translation, rRNA processing, tRNA modification, and mRNA decay ( Table 2 , Figure 2 , and Table S5). One of the strong concordances was observed with 5-fluorouridine (0.42), an FDA-approved anticancer drug that is thought to also act by two mechanisms: (i) inhibiting thymidylate synthetase and (ii) through metabolism into cytotoxic ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides that can be incorporated into DNA and RNA ( Table 3 ) [ 14 ]."

These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.","The finding of both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is further evidence for activity of both ammonia signaling and stress defense pathways, as ammonia signaling utilizes mostly caspase independent pathways (Vachova and Palkova 2005 ) and stress defense is mediated mostly by apoptosis as well as autophagy and necrosis (Farrugia and Balzan 2012 ). In our model system composed of a near-solid colony of yeast, receiving nutrients from an agar gel at its base, and using a gas, ammonia, as one means of driving differentiation within the colony, spaceflight, rotating wall vessel and random positioning generate different effects. In conclusion, by allowing graded manipulation of a combination of convection and ammonia signaling, while avoiding secondary effects of gene deletion, these physical techniques are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation."
Effects of space flight on mouse liver versus kidney: Gene pathway analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6321533/,"Abstract Understanding genome wide, tissue-specific, and spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice flown in space for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? Although there were tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.","Our findings in these areas are consistent with the other reports on the livers from mice flown in space, such as an altered ability to respond to insulin [ 4 ], impaired management of reactive oxidation (an integral part of apoptosis) [ 3 , 5 ], dysregulated lipid metabolism [ 3 , 4 ], and altered protein kinases [ 5 ]. performed unbiased, unsupervised, and integrated multi-omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic data sets on liver tissue derived from nine-week old weight-matched female C57BL/6J mice flown in space for 13.5 days [ 3 ].

Role of shear stress on renal proximal tubular cells for nephrotoxicity assays,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9146534/,"Abstract Increased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial cells.

Results There were no statistically-significant differences in surgical field clarity grade ( P = .577) and tympanic membrane flap flipping time ( P = .490) among 4 concentration groups.","Our study showed that at 1 minute after injection, the HR- and BP-related parameters (HR, MAP, SBP, DBP) of the 4 groups almost all increased compared with the baseline value, especially in the 1:5000 group, whose related data had very significant statistical differences. It is worth noting that, except for the patients in the 1:5000 concentration group, the curve of HR- and BP-related indicators of the patient presented a double-wave peak shape, showing an upward trend immediately after epinephrine injection, falling back 5 minutes after injection, then rising again, and then slowly falling back to baseline. Taking into account the impact of 4 concentration groups on patient’s surgical field clarity and hemodynamics, in order to reduce the risk of adverse reactions when the benefits obtained are similar, we believe that it is more recommended to choose a concentration that has a smaller impact on patients’ hemodynamic parameters, that is, a concentration of epinephrine adenosine/physiological saline between 1:20,000 and 1:40,000."

This is not surprising because multifidus atrophy can exist in elite, highly conditioned athletes [ 55 ], and given the unique role of the multifidus as a stabilizer to stiffen the trunk rather than create motion, it requires specific training regimens directed toward proper activation [ 56 – 58 ]. Weakening at the disc-vertebra junction could be exacerbated by microgravity-induced changes in vertebral bone quality [ 48 , 61 ] and increased disc loading from lumbar flattening [ 25 ] that together heighten risk of failure and injury at the disc-bone interface when reintroducing a relatively less stable lumbar spine to gravitational load."
Fifteen days of microgravity causes growth in calvaria of mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110898/,"While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading by tissue.","By artificially incrementing intramedullary fluid pressure in the femurs of hindlimb-unloaded rats and noting subsequent increases in bone mineral content and size of the femur, Bergula and co-workers establish the capability of ISF flow to alter bone-remodeling independent of skeletal loading [ 24 ]. A study analyzing effects of long-duration spaceflight missions (average length of 176 ±45 days) shows substantial reductions in bone mineral density in several weight-bearing bones including the lumbar spine and leg, resulting in a total body BMD decrease of 0.35%/month [ 19 ]. Following 17-week horizontal bed rest, several weight-bearing bones including the lumbar spine and the calcaneus suffer mineral losses ranging from 2.2 to 10.4% while an increase of 3.4% is noted in the skull, a finding supported by our data [ 27 ]."
Altered disc compression in children with idiopathic low back pain: an upright magnetic resonance imaging backpack study,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947616/,"Abstract Study Design This study is a repeated measures design to measure the lumbar spine’s response to common backpack loads in children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) using upright MRI. Objective The purpose of this study is to analyze the lumbar spine’s response to backpack loads with upright MRI in ILBP children in order to compare their results to previously published normal child data under the same conditions. IVD height, lumbar lordosis, lumbar coronal deformity, and pain score were recorded after each condition and compared using ANOVAs. We compared the above variables between ILBP and normal subjects using generalized least squares models. Compared to normal children, ILBP children experience less lumbar IVD compression, less lumbar lordosis, and more pain due to increasing load suggesting altered mechanisms for load tolerance in ILBP children.","11 The lack of a difference in lumbar asymmetry’s response to increasing backpack load between healthy and ILBP subjects suggests that the greater pain experienced by ILBP subjects with increasing backpack loads is not due to differences in lumbar asymmetry. In adults, muscle fatigue leads to changes in muscle recruitment patterns, increases in spinal force, and an increase in spinal instability, which may all contribute to low back pain. 20 Physical therapy (PT) aimed at paraspinal muscle strengthening in ILBP children may normalize the observed back pain with increasing backpack load and possibly redistribute the load to the IVDs. Future studies could test this hypothesis by analyzing the effect of backpack loading on the lumbar spine in normal and ILBP subjects after PT."
Spaceflight-induced bone loss alters failure mode and reduces bending strength in murine spinal segments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477841/,"Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to quantify bone properties. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.","This suggests one of two possible failure mechanisms: (i) mechanical bending tore the growth plate, allowing rapid hyper-flexion that induced bony fractures, or (ii) mechanical bending fractured the epiphyseal bone, allowing a fragment of bone to tear away with the annulus fibrosus, bringing along an adjacent fragment of growth plate tissue. It should also be noted that the study design made it necessary to impose two freeze/thaw cycles (one after dissection on landing day and one after mechanical testing) that made it unfeasible to extract reliable biochemical and genetic information from the growth plate and disc. However, the mechanical properties measured in this study were likely unaffected by the re-acclimation or freeze-thaw cycles, as supported by prior work showing that (i) diminished compressive properties of murine discs during spaceflight do not recover over a 7-day post-flight period, 15 and (ii) frozen storage has little to no effect on the elastic response of porcine or human discs, 44 – 46 compressive creep properties of human discs, 47 or flexion/extension rigidity of sheep discs."
Spaceflight-associated vascular remodeling and gene expression in mouse calvaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9139491/,"Abstract Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body.","The mechanosensitivity of bone cells to compressive forces and subsequent increase in bone formation in response to mechanical stimuli is known, calvarial adaptations to cephalad fluid shifts, increased intracranial pressure, and cerebrovascular regulation due to microgravity exposure are poorly understood. This is in contrast to previous reports that show that loss of sclerostin increases cranial bone growth and regeneration and sclerostin antibodies are used to increase bone mass in clinical trials of osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta ( Kang et al., 2018 ; Scheiber et al., 2019 ) suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in bone formation. The proliferative capacity of the bone marrow stromal and hematopoietic precursors decreases in the BION-M1 mouse population cohort of mice ( Markina et al., 2018 ) which may explain our findings that the vessel diameter and number of vessels are unchanged in BION-M1 compared to STS-131 ( Figure 2 )."
"Exposure of Mycobacterium marinum to low-shear modeled microgravity: Effect on growth, the transcriptome and survival under stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515531/,"marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection.","typhimurium had decreased doubling time in minimal medium, 29 Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis reached higher cell densities and had increased growth rate during spaceflight compared with ground controls, 45 while S. This experiment demonstrated different mixing rates under the two conditions: even after 12 h the crystal violet had dispersed only around the circumference of the HARV subjected to LSMMG, while complete dispersal had occurred under NG. 30 Sensitivity to H 2 O 2 could be altered by the availability of detoxification enzymes (catalase and alkyl hydroperoxidases), proteins involved in ‘repairing’ oxidized proteins (thioredoxins and methionine sulfoxide reductases) or redox buffers such as mycothiol and ergothioneine."
Effects of mechanostimulation on gravitropism and signal persistence in flax roots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258067/,"Abstract Gravitropism describes curvature of plants in response to gravity or differential acceleration and clinorotation is commonly used to compensate unilateral effect of gravity. Flax roots were reoriented (placed horizontally for 5, 10 or 15 min) and clinorotated at a rate of 0.5 to 5 rpm either vertically (parallel to the gravity vector and root axis) or horizontally (perpendicular to the gravity vector and parallel to the root axis). However, maximal curvature for vertical clinorotation decreased with increasing rate of rotation and produced straight roots at 5 rpm. The point of maximal curvature was used to determine the longevity (memory) of the gravity signal, which lasted about 120 min.","This notion and the observation that different angular velocities during clinorotation affect the magnitude of the response, suggests that the understanding of clinorotation as a gravi-compensator (constantly changing the gravity vector) or a stimulus (rotation) that has to be faster than the response time is insufficient. Investigations with excess starch mutants indicate that gravisensing is not saturated 41 and studies of the presentation time show that much shorter reorientation times than signal saturation are sufficient to induce curvature and suggest that amyloplast sedimentation is not necessary for the initiation of gravitropism. The stronger auto-straightening in vertically clinorotated roots in combination with the reduced growth rate and reduced curvature indicates that vertical clinorotation inhibits the formation of lateral auxin gradients or facilitates the uniform redistribution of growth regulators more than horizontal clinorotation."
Oxygen dependency of germinating Brassica seeds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10025027/,"In contrast, different priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor germination performances. Overall, the results established the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.","Second, salt stress has been linked to ion toxicity and osmotic stress in cellular metabolic processes, resulting in lower turgor pressure due to increased negative water potential, both of which affect growth traits such as shoot root length, plant vigor, seedling growth, and biomass [ , , , ]. Priming improves water uptake, causing the cell cycle in the G2 phase to proceed faster in pre-treated seeds than in non-pre-treated seeds, which can lead to cell synchronization [ 83 ], increased sugar content, organically producing compounds and modifying the Metabolic activities during seed germination and ultimately lead to uniform and better development of seedlings [ 84 ]. However, the lowest level of proline was found in the case of hydropriming alone, although it was much greater than the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control and was considerably similar to seedlings primed with lower concentrations of PEG and TU ( Fig."
"Desiccation mitigates heat stress in the resurrection fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733933/,"Abstract Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Chlorophyll fluorescence (F t ) and quantum yield (Q y ) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids.","Discolorations of hydrated fronds after exposure to ≥ 35°C ( Figures 2E–I ) and re-hydrated fronds after exposure to > 55°C ( Figure 2 ) indicate that these fronds have experienced stress beyond their thermal tolerance resulting in chloroplast or chlorophyll degradation, which eventually leads to senescence ( Jespersen et al., 2016 ) and programmed cell death (PCD) ( Qu et al., 2009 ; Wang et al., 2015 ). Similar to observations in dried tissue, this unequal response indicates a dichotomy between chlorophyll stability and reduced photosynthetic efficiency, possibly as a result from inactivation of the oxygen evolving system ( Wise et al., 2004 ) and/or the PS II reaction center ( Bolharnordenkampe et al., 1989 ). One could speculate that the stress response to drying includes enhanced lipid biosynthesis ( Quartacci et al., 2002 ) to maintain membrane fluidity ( Murata and Los, 1997 ; Ahmad et al., 2013 ) and that elevated temperatures enhance respiration such that beta oxidation of FAs leads to their lowered content."
Transcription profile of auxin related genes during positively gravitropic hypocotyl curvature of Brassica rapa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9105288/,"Abstract Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes. Keywords: Brassica rapa , Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE), germination, gravitropism, hypocotyl, root","The initiation and termination of bending [ 65 ] is in line with our observation that the hypocotyl cortex that was probed by SPGE and shows the PIN1 and PIN3 transcription pattern that initially activates the auxin flow to the upper flank, but eventually reverses its lateral polarity to account for the upward orientation of the hypocotyl [ 1 ]. As the downregulation of all genes on the upper flank at the beginning of hypocotyl curvature (four hours) is greater than the upregulation on the bottom side, the differential ratio (up/down, Figure 5 and Figure 6 ) is high and suggests auxin flow to the lower flank. However, the effect of auxin levels and ensuing gene transcription will also be affected by the cessation of the ability to elongate; therefore, the maturing tissue no longer responds to changes in auxin-mediated development and the reversal in hypocotyl curvature, i.e., negative gravitropism, depends on tissue that is still expanding."
High-gradient magnetic fields and starch metabolism: Results from a space experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9617909/,Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields.,"Although common reference genes (e.g., TUB1, ACT7 ) are represented (Table 3 ), the observation that individual tissues differed in the genes of greatest stability and that the average of all tissues resulted in different assortments suggested that referring transcription data to the average of all measurements (i.e., the regression lines in Figs.

Although the STS-107 flight experiment could not be retrieved to measure amyloplast size, the image analysis of flax seedlings indicated that the magnetic gradient had stronger effects than during previous ground experiments because the root curvature started at a greater distance from the HGMF-inducing wedge 27 than during ground controls."
Lipid rafts and plant gravisensitivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9695138/,"Abstract The necessity to include plants as a component of a Bioregenerative Life Support System leads to investigations to optimize plant growth facilities as well as a better understanding of the plant cell membrane and its numerous activities in the signaling, transport, and sensing of gravity, drought, and other stressors. Variable but stabilized microdomains form in membranes that include specific lipids and proteins that became known as (detergent-resistant) membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts with various subclassifications. The enhanced saturated fatty acid content in lipid rafts after clinorotation suggests increased rigidity and reduced membrane permeability as a primary response to abiotic and mechanical stress. These intricately linked structures and functions provide multiple future research directions to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in physiological processes.",The data and inferences described so far clearly indicate that the functional domains of membranes are critically important for signal integration and responses. We hope that this review will prompt future research on the effect of lipid rafts and membrane functions on general and gravitational physiology.
Expression and characterization of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS in Xenopus laevis oocytes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3503204/,"One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels.","We reproducibly observed this behavior in experiments with pipettes of various diameters (BN 4–7), at opposite membrane potentials, under both positive and negative pipette pressures, with different ramp speeds, buffer compositions, and number of channels activated, making it unlikely to be an artifact ( Figs. Bulky residues at these positions may make the pore-lining helix of MSL10 stiffer and allow the channel to maintain the open state for a longer period, even when little or no membrane tension is applied. Thus, the electrophysiological characterization of a MscS homolog from a multicellular system opens up the exciting possibility that some members of this family of MS channels may not only release osmolytes from swelling cells and organelles, but also alter cell physiology and potentially participate in intercellular signaling."
United in Diversity: Mechanosensitive Ion Channels in Plants,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896955/,"Abstract Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain.

Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.","While RNA seq data suggests that somatosensory neurons contain all of the enzymatic machinery required to produce and export local S1P ( Usoskin et al., 2015 ; Morita et al., 2015 ), future work will be needed to identify the key cell types that are important for maintaining baseline S1P levels in the skin to regulate mechanical sensitivity and for increasing S1P under inflammatory/injury conditions to promote pain hypersensitivity. For example, although Piezo2 -hypomorphic animals exhibit normal mechanical pain behaviors ( Ranade et al., 2014 ), ex vivo skin-nerve recordings show that their AM nociceptors display decreased force-responsiveness ( Ranade et al., 2014 ), and a recent study found that subpopulations of sensory neurons express different splice variants of Piezo2 that exhibit different force sensitivities ( Szczot et al., 2017 ). Other studies have shown that KCNQ channels mediate excitability of Aδ fibers ( Schütze et al., 2016 ; Passmore et al., 2012 ) and are required for normal mechanonociceptive responses in dorsal horn neurons receiving Aδ input ( Passmore et al., 2012 ), and that opening KCNQ2/3 channels directly with retigabine alleviates pain in vivo ( Xu et al., 2010 ; Hayashi et al., 2014 ; Blackburn-Munro and Jensen, 2003 )."

A good starting point for recording settings would include the following: (1) acquisition at 20 kHz with the amplifier’s low pass filter set to 5–10 kHz (depending on the available settings); (2) a 4–5 s pressure ramp of −20 to −80 mmHg (depending on the pipette size, see Note 26 ), which in most cases eliminates artifacts caused by a too rapid increase in tension; and (3) a holding potential of 20 mV to 40 mV (pipette voltage) for the inside-out configuration, which typically provides clean and artifact-free traces ( see Notes 26 and 27 ).

The ongoing search for the molecular basis of plant osmosensing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411250/,"[Abstract Not Found; Full Article Summary]: This term is often used by plant researchers, but it is entirely possible that mechanical stimuli caused by change in membrane tension, cell wall damage, or the disruption of plasma membrane–cell wall connections are relevant factors in osmosensing, in addition to or instead of altered extracellular osmolarity per se (see Fig. The downstream effects of water limitation on plants that are commonly assayed include: the accumulation of compatible solutes such as proline, the induction of protective proteins such as dehydrins, the production of the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), and increased sensitivity to ABA treatment in physiological assays ( Verslues and Juenger, 2011 ; Christmann et al., 2013 ). Several osmosensors involved in hyperosmotic signaling through the Saccharomyces cerevisiae high osmolarity glycerol response (HOG)1 pathway, including the histidine kinase Synthetic Lethal of N-end rule 1 (SLN1), were originally proposed to function in this manner, but recent data suggest that one or more of the other mechanisms listed below may instead be involved ( Saito and Posas, 2012 ). Alternatively, a novel calcium channel, REDUCED HYPEROSMOLARITY-INDUCED [Ca 2+ ] i INCREASE (OSCA)1, has recently been reported to be activated by hyperosmolarity and to be genetically required for several stress-related phenotypes ( Hou et al., 2014 ; Yuan et al., 2014 ); additional physiological experiments are needed to fully understand the role of OSCA1 and related channels in drought response. Finally, the cytoskeleton is intricately involved in force sensing and controlling cell shape in mammalian cells (see accompanying Perspective by Sachs and Sivaselvan ) and is likely to have as-yet-undiscovered roles in the perception and signaling of osmotic stress in plants (in addition to controlling cell wall deposition and other properties).","1 ; (b) characterizing the nature of the osmotic stress response signaling pathways upstream of the phytohormone ABA and distinguishing it from responses to other abiotic stresses; and (c) using a wider range of assays in genetic screens to include the full range of phenotypes relevant for plant adaptation to water-limited environments.

Plastid osmotic stress influences cell differentiation at the plant shoot apex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5047659/,"Abstract The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL . Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4.","Several previously identified callus-producing mutants in Arabidopsis and Helianthus also exhibit upregulated CK signaling and defects in meristem identity gene expression, including tsd1 ( Frank et al., 2002 ; Krupkova and Schmulling, 2009 ), EMB-2 ( Chiappetta et al., 2006 ) and the pasticcino mutants ( Faure et al., 1998 ; Harrar et al., 2003 ). However, the application of pharmacological inhibitors of plastid development or function was used to demonstrate that leaf adaxial/abaxial patterning is regulated by plastid protein translation in a GUN1-dependent pathway ( Tameshige et al., 2013 ), a pathway that is required to facilitate the switch from leaf cell proliferation to expansion and differentiation ( Andriankaja et al., 2012 ). These results add yet another layer of complexity to the many regulatory pathways and feedback loops that govern dynamic cell identity decision-making at the plant shoot apex and provide a foundation for future investigation into the relationship between meristem identity and plastid osmotic homeostasis in the SAM."
Spaceflight-induced synaptic modifications within hair cells of the mammalian utricle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5454470/,"Spaceflight imposes a radically different sensory environment from that in which the inner ear utricle normally operates. We investigated synaptic modifications in utricles from mice flown aboard a space shuttle mission. Structural synaptic plasticity was detected in the medial extrastriola, a region associated with encoding static head position, as decreased synapse density. These results are remarkably congruent with a recent report of decreased utricular function in astronauts immediately after returning from the International Space Station.","Synapse Density Decrease Implies a “Use It or Lose It” Plasticity Guideline The unloading of the utricular epithelium in microgravity results in the condition where stereocilia displacements during static changes in head orientation, and the concomitant modulation in hair cell membrane potential, do not occur. Perhaps the largest impact may be borne out of the large difference in body mass between mice and rats, influencing not only locomotor behavior but also other physiological systems (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal) during spaceflight, potentially having notable impact on systemic load sensing that may feed back to the vestibular periphery via efferent mechanisms. Evidence of Peripheral Vestibular Adaptation in Astronauts The present investigation demonstrates that 15 days of microgravity exposure, which was a typical mission duration of the space shuttle era, is sufficient to induce structural plasticity in utricular hair cell afferent synapses in the mouse and that this change persists in the immediate postlanding hours."
Effects of angular frequency during clinorotation on mesenchymal stem cell morphology and migration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515506/,"Abstract Aims: To determine the short-term effects of simulated microgravity on mesenchymal stem cell behaviors—as a function of clinorotation speed—using time-lapse microscopy. Background: Ground-based microgravity simulation can reproduce the apparent effects of weightlessness in spaceflight using clinostats that continuously reorient the gravity vector on a specimen, creating a time-averaged nullification of gravity. Cytoarchitecture was assessed by actin and vinculin staining, and chemotaxis was examined using time-lapse light microscopy of cells in NGF (100 ng/ml) gradients. Results: Among clinorotated groups, cell area distributions indicated a greater inhibition of cell spreading with higher angular frequency ( P <0.005), though average cell area at 30 rpm after 8 h became statistically similar to control ( P =0.794).","Understanding how angular frequency, or rotation speed, of clinorotation affects cell behavior is a critical aspect of microgravity simulation experiments, so that the role of the changing gravity vector in cellular regulation can be appropriately considered. Potential candidates could be one or more molecules already known to play important roles in cellular mechanoregulation, such as the Rho family of GTPases, 33 ion mechanosensitive channels, 34 intracellular calcium, 35 nuclear deformations, 36 focal adhesions, or other cell surface receptors. 37 Although mechanosensitive pathways seem the most direct apparatus for gravisensing, others have also suggested the importance of external environmental factors including fluid shear, fluid and nutrient exchange, oxygen content, buoyancy, and changes in the extracellular matrix."
"The role of FGF-2 and BMP-2 in regulation of gene induction, cell proliferation and mineralization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044105/,"Materials and methods The regulation of gene expression was determined using real-time RTPCR (qRTPCR) and cell proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation or fluorescent analysis of DNA content in MC3T3E1 osteoblast-like cells. Results Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) had the greatest ability to induce proliferation after 24 hours of treatment when compared to transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ). We found that FGF-2 caused the most significant induction of expression of early growth response-1 ( egr-1), fgf-2, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2), tgfβ and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (mmp-3) associated with proliferation and expression of angiogenic genes like vascular endothelial growth factor A ( vegfA) and its receptor vegfr1 . Conclusions The ability of FGF-2 to re-program a mineralizing gene expression profile to one of proliferation suggests that FGF-2 plays a critical role of osteoblast growth in early fracture repair while BMP-2 is instrumental in stimulating mineralization.","Treatment of the mineralized defect model with FGF-2 resulted in gene expression that corresponds to de-differentiation (e.g. significant increases in growth related genes egf-1, fgf-2 , cox-2, TGFβ, vegfA, vegfr and mmp3 and down-regulation of mineralizing related genes). Vegf and vegfr1 are primary regulators of angiogenesis, while MMP3 is thought to play a major role on cell behaviors such as proliferation and migration [ 30 ] which may explain the ability of the FGF-2 to enable the cultured cells to fill the defect void efficiently. In the early stages of mineralization, the major protein (greater than 20%) synthesized by the osteoblast is collagen, however collagen is not a major component of the proliferating cell, suggesting that FGF-2 stimulates proliferation partly through its ability to drastically reduce the relative abundance of a majority of the mineralizing-associated genes."
"Nutritional supplements, COX-2 and IGF-1 expression in men on active surveillance for prostate cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002170/,"We examined the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements versus placebo on the normal prostate microenvironment, among men pursuing active surveillance for low-burden prostate cancer. We hypothesized that lycopene or fish oil supplements would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF - 1 ) and cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX - 2 ) gene expression, respectively, reflecting putative proliferation ( IGF - 1 ) and inflammatory ( COX - 2 ) pathways relevant to carcinogenesis. Methods We conducted a 3-month randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression profiles (assessed by qRT–PCR) among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer receiving either 30 mg/day lycopene, 3 g/day fish oil (including 1,098 mg eicosapentaenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acid s ) or placebo. Conclusion Compared to placebo, 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil did not significantly change IGF - 1 and COX - 2 gene expression in the normal prostate microenvironment in men with low-burden prostate cancer.","We previously reported that men who increased their post-diagnostic consumption of tomato sauce by two servings per week had an estimated 20% reduction in the risk of prostate cancer recurrence or progression ( p value = 0.04), independent of baseline clinical features and primary treatment option [ 11 ]. The hypothesis that fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids interact with or affect inflammatory pathways has gained some support from a few studies that observed a stronger effect of these foods or nutrients on prostate cancer risk among men with specific germ line variants in COX - 2 [ 35 , 37 ]. The 3-month intervention might also have been too short a duration to observe biologic effects in the prostate, although other studies with short nutritional interventions in men with prostate cancer have detected gene expression changes [ 29 , 43 , 44 ] including one conducted by our collaborative group in a similar population focused on a comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention [ 9 ]."

Hyperoxia inhibits T cell activation in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11470607/,"Abstract Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, the abnormal proliferate and differentiate ability of type II epithelial cells (AEC II) is the key to the pathological basis of BPD. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α.","To further investigate whether the increase and activation of iNKT cells is associated with impaired lung differentiation in BPD, we used anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody interfering with iNKT cells activation status in BPD mice, the number of immune cells in BALF significantly reduced, H&E staining showed that as the activation status and abundance of iNKT cells decreased, the alveolar structure tended to be regular, the number of alveoli increased and alveoli cavity was more uniform, RAC increased and MLI decreased, PAS showed a decrease in glycogen, WB and tissue immunofluorescence showed that SP-C, T1α increased, and fluorescence localization showed that SP-C and T1α co-localization increased, these results suggested that the abnormal development in BPD mice was alleviated after using anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody. To further investigate whether iNKT cells activation exacerbates lung development disorder in BPD, in this study, we used nasal instillation of α-Galcer, a specific activator of iNKT cells [ 29 ], in addition to extract iNKT cells by magnetic beads and adoptive transfer into mice via the tail vein. The expression of T1α is different in vivo and in vitro under hyperoxia, which may be related to the following reasons: firstly, environment is not the same in vivo and in vitro, in vivo, cells are affected by many factors, including signal transduction between cells, immune response, etc., while in vitro culture, the cell environment is relatively simplified, may lead to different response patterns; secondly, the length of hyperoxia exposure is also different, 72 h of hyperoxia exposure is an acute lung injury, T1α compensatory increase."
"Effects of gravitational mechanical unloading in endothelial cells: association between caveolins, inflammation and adhesion molecules",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603133/,"Abstract Mechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell (ECs) function, and have been implicated in vascular disease as well as physiologic changes associated with low gravity environments. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines.","The present study demonstrates that microgravity alters the cytoskeleton of ECs. It appears that the actin filaments become disorganized and redistributed within the cells, with as a possible consequence an inability to transport molecules to the outside of the cells, such as the caveolins to the caveolae at the plasma membrane. Our findings support a role of increased NO production in the pathophysiology of post-spaceflight OI but more importantly, suggest that this variable may be improved by the addition of artificial gravity since 3 periods of 30 minutes of hypergravity in this study reversed the changes seen in microgravity. Although the significance of the findings with regards to an overall “dysregulation” of the cells compared to a true change towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype need to be further assessed, our findings would suggest that microgravity may have a beneficial impact on the health of blood vessels."
n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation in peripheral artery disease: the OMEGA-PAD trial,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6462350/,"Materials and methods: The OMEGA-PAD II trial was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of 3 mo of high-dose oral n-3 PUFA supplementation on inflammation, endothelial function, and walking ability in patients with PAD. Outcomes measured included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, the omega-3 index, endothelial function as measured via flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, and a 6-min walk test. There were no significant changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, flow-mediated vasodilation, walking impairment questionnaire, or 6-min walk test in the fish oil group. Keywords: Peripheral artery disease, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, Fish oils, Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, Other pharmacotherapy","In addition, there were significant increases in downstream EPA and DHA products, including several SPMs, which have been demonstrated to be potent mediators of inflammation-resolution and have biological roles that could potentially explain several previously reported cardioprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs. 8 , 9 Although the OMEGA-PAD I trial originally identified significant increases in intermediates of SPM biosynthesis (e.g., HDHA and HEPE) after 1 mo of fish oil supplementation, it did not identify significant changes in SPM end products (e.g., resolvins and lipoxins) as reported in the current trial. The mechanism through which n-3 PUFA supplementation and the omega-3 index could have protective effects has been proposed to be via increasing the production of mediators of resolution of inflammation, specifically SPMs. Recent research demonstrates that the resolution of inflammation is an active process driven by SPMs, which are derived from n-3 and n-6 PUFAs. 8 These SPMs are generated via specific biosynthetic pathways and represent distinct classes including lipoxins derived from AA or EPA; the E-series resolvins generated from EPA; and the DHA-derived D-series resolvins, protectins, and maresins. 33 – 36 This trial, despite the small sample size, provides substantial evidence that patients with PAD are capable of utilizing EPA and DHA in endogenous enzymatic pathways that increase the production of SPMs. Lipoxins and resolvins regulate leukocyte-endothelial interactions, 37 , 38 reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species, 39 and regulate the production of prostacyclin 40 and nitric oxide."
Molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced functions of three-dimensional hepatocyte aggregates,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012541/,"Abstract Three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocytes leads to improved and prolonged synthetic and metabolic functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo , primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α ( Hnf4a ) binding sites in their promoters. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications.","In this study, we used global gene expression profiling and promoter region analyses to identify molecular differences between primary mouse hepatocytes cultured as monolayers on TCDs and as 3D aggregates generated in RWVs. Our results indicated that improved synthetic and metabolic functions in hepatocyte 3D aggregates reflected the upregulated expression of a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes compared to monolayer cultures. While cell-matrix interactions dominate in hepatocyte monolayers cultured on collagen-coated TCDs, 3D cell-cell interactions dominate within self-aggregated spheroids generated in RWVs. These findings suggest that 3D cell-cell interactions are important for sustained expression of Hnf4a, which in turn plays a key role in maintaining differentiated hepatocyte functions in 3D aggregates. Several EMT inducers and mesenchymal cell markers ( Snail , Vim , and Loxl2 ) were highly upregulated in TCDs as compared RWVs. In addition, expression levels of several cytoskeletal genes not previously described in monolayer culture ( Acta1 , Tpm2 , and Flna ) were also significantly increased in TCDs compared to RWVs. There is evidence that Hnf4a actively represses the mesenchymal program in hepatocytes in conjunction with maintaining hepatocyte-specific differentiated functions."
Spaceflight alters expression of microRNA during T-cell activation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653058/,"Abstract Altered immune function has been demonstrated in astronauts during spaceflights dating back to Apollo and Skylab; this could be a major barrier to long-term space exploration. Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed under microgravity. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target genes and limit the immune response. Moreover, this study suggests that T-cell activation itself may induce a sequence of gene expressions that is self-limited by miR-21.—Hughes-Fulford, M., Chang, T.","In the data presented here, we show for the first time an altered profile of miRNA expression under true microgravity compared to its onboard normal gravity controls; all samples were isolated from donors on earth, incubated, activated, and fixed in ISS on-orbit operations. It is notable that several of the miR-21 targets are initially up-regulated in T-cell activation, and it is possible that as miR-21 levels rise in the cell, this miRNA will cause a reduction in the protein synthesis of these targets and may be another mechanism to limit the time of T-cell activation. In this laboratory’s previous work on activation of T cells, gel shift analysis revealed that the activator protein 1 (AP1) transcriptional factor was activated by protein kinase A and was blocked by a MAPK inhibitor, U016, with AP1 being a key player in T-cell activation ( 13 ) ( Fig."
Spaceflight impairs antigen-specific tolerance induction in vivo and increases inflammatory cytokines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6137544/,"Abstract The health risks of a dysregulated immune response during spaceflight are important to understand as plans emerge for humans to embark on long-term space travel to Mars. In this first-of-its-kind study, we used adoptive transfer of T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II CD4 T cells to track an in vivo antigen-specific immune response that was induced during the course of spaceflight. Experimental mice destined for spaceflight and mice that remained on the ground received transferred OT-II cells and cognate peptide stimulation with ovalbumin (OVA) 323-339 plus the inflammatory adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A. Numbers of OT-II cells in flight mice treated with OVA were significantly increased by 2-fold compared with ground mice treated with OVA, suggesting that tolerance induction was impaired by spaceflight.","On the basis of our in vivo results and findings from previous in vitro T-cell spaceflight experiments, we hypothesize that microgravity during spaceflight predominantly inhibited IL-2 and CD25 up-regulation during T-cell activation, leading to a disproportionate decrease in T reg cells and subsequent impairment in tolerance that is manifested as heightened inflammatory responses. Additional studies are required to determine whether spaceflight impairs unique memory T-cell functions, such as efficient homing to lymphoid organs, increased life span, and faster response kinetics ( 32 ), resulting in less effective immune responses in other contexts. There are examples in humans in which the host’s hyperstimulated inflammatory responses induce more overall damage than the inciting infectious agent or agents ( e.g., sepsis.) Our results raise the possibility that humans who acquire an infection during long-term spaceflight, such as on an exploratory mission to Mars, may develop excessive inflammatory responses and associated adverse consequences."
"From cellular mechanotransduction to biologically inspired engineering: 2009 Pritzker Award Lecture, BMES Annual Meeting October 10, 2009.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2913424/,"Here, I review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. This path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. In addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non-invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new DNA-based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","I hope that I fully communicated the challenges I have faced as a biologist who believed that mechanics and structure are as important regulators of cell and tissue function as chemicals and genes. In order to do interdisciplinary research and pursue unconventional ideas successfully, it is necessary to demonstrate to one’s critics that you can use the same approaches they do, and obtain the same results. It is only when you have their respect as a peer, that you can go further and show that by looking at the problem from a slightly different perspective or using a new technology, you can explain things that they cannot, using existing approaches."
Crewmember microbiome may influence microbial composition of ISS habitable surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190111/,"Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember’s microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during and post-flight. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember’s skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. These data support future crew and ISS microbial surveillance efforts and the design of preventive measures to maintain crew habitat onboard spacecraft destined for long term space travel.","In a relatively small mostly closed environment, the consequences of these communities deviating from normal could present significant challenges—as minor as increased cleaning time to food, air, and water problems that can have negative implications for crewmember health and the success of the whole mission. The present data is the initial report of a study employing metagenomic sequencing to analyze the composition of crewmember microbiome at the ISS and its association ISS environmental microbiome, leveraging an extensive taxonomically annotated sequence database and a fast and sensitive k -mer based read mapping strategy. When compared with ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember (Flight 4, collected in June 2017), another flight in the same MT-2 study (Flight 5, collected in January 2018) and three previous flights conducted in the prior MT-1 study (Flights 1–3, collected between March 2015 to May 2016), it was observed that the crewmember skin samples were more closely related to Flights 4 and 5 environmental samples than Flights 1–3, and skin samples were more similar to the ISS surface samples than saliva, mouth and nostril samples ( Fig 5 )."
Sierra Nevada sweep: Metagenomic measurements of bioaerosols vertically distributed across the troposphere.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382458/,"Abstract To explore how airborne microbial patterns change with height above the Earth’s surface, we flew NASA’s C-20A aircraft on two consecutive days in June 2018 along identical flight paths over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range at four different altitudes ranging from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft. Bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing. To estimate bioaerosol dispersal, we developed a human exposure likelihood model (7-day forecast) using general aerosol characteristics and measured meteorological conditions.","With an aerobiology study flown into the upper troposphere, we detected changing microbial abundance with height above the Earth’s surface – our dataset was reliant upon a shotgun metagenomics approach analyzing samples acquired between 10,000 to 40,000 ft, on two consecutive summer days over the US Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. Another unexpected DNA signal was Pinus (second flight day at 10,000 ft), suggesting the sampled air mass had recently passed over forested terrain in the US Sierra Nevada mountains – taken together with the back trajectory model at 10,000 ft, the result might demonstrate how orographic uplift connects regional surface emissions with the upper atmosphere. Most previous vertical aerobiology studies relied upon 16S rRNA amplicon methods, which targets and PCR-amplifies short regions of the 16S gene, for characterizing bacteria sampled 4 , 12 , 45 , 50 , 51 , whereas our shotgun metagenomics approach has the capacity to detect a broader taxonomic range with higher resolution, to the species or strain/plasmid level."

"Microbial tracking-2, a metagenomics analysis of bacteria and fungi onboard the International Space Station.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9241228/,"Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 10 5 cfu/m 2 Conclusions Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.","Two recent studies have noted that the crew microbiome may shape microbial composition on ISS habitable surfaces [ 29 , 30 ], and in this study, the majority of bacteria and fungi that were detected from surfaces were human-associated, such as Staphylococcus , Propionibacterium , Streptococcus , Haemophilus , and Malassezia or those related to food products that are ingested by humans, such as Aspergillus kawachii and Lactococcus lactis . Aspergillus biofilms (i) cause aspergillosis, an infection causing allergic reactions, lung disease, and infections in other organs [ 45 , 46 ]; (ii) have been implicated in microbially induced corrosion of bronze and copper [ 47 ]; and (iii) have been found in tap water in private homes, hospitals, and industrial premises, resulting in altered taste, odor, the production of allergenic compounds, and mycotoxins [ 48 , 49 ]. This may be significant in the context of a recent study comparing “unrestricted” built environments (public houses, public buildings, private houses) with “confined” built environments (intensive care units (ICU), cleanrooms, cleanroom gowning areas) where it was shown that each of the three “confined” environments had a considerably higher representation of amino acid utilization compared to carbohydrate utilization, with the opposite being true for the “unrestricted” environments (higher carbohydrate utilization compared to amino acids) [ 50 ]."

Keywords: machine learning, skeletal muscle atrophy, graph convolutional neural networks, graph neural network, random forest, gradient boosting method, knowledge graphs, node embeddings, random walk, diseases, drugs, link prediction","The GCN link prediction method has achieved the highest accuracy of 96.11%, as seen from AUROC values for the ten-fold cross validation accuracies for the four methods of RF, GB, GNN and GCN given in Table 2 . A decrease in muscle mass is associated with: (1) increased conjugation of ubiquitin to muscle proteins; (2) increased proteasomal ATP-dependent activity; (3) increased protein breakdown that can be efficiently blocked by proteasome inhibitors; and (4) upregulation of transcripts encoding ubiquitin, some ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), a few ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3) and several proteasome subunits [ 39 ]. Resistive Exercise (RE) with superimposed vibration mechanosignals (RVE) is proposed to counter muscle atrophy, which is effective against the over expression of Mitochondrial Ribosomal Proteins (MRPs) and Mitochondrial Tu Translation Elongation Factor ( TUFM ) that cause muscle atrophy [ 44 ]."
Release of CD36-associated cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA as a hallmark of space environment response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166646/,"Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirms previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. RNA-sequencing of the CD36 fraction reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma mitochondrial components originated from various tissues. We compare our plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission, which had used on-board artificial gravity, and discover a link between microgravity and the observed mitochondrial responses.","In this study, we could not obtain conclusive results to determine whether plasma mitochondrial components represented intact exMTs or cytosolic mitochondrial DNAs and RNAs included in EVs. exMT release into plasma under metabolic stress and tissue injury has been proposed as a defensive mechanism, whereby damaged mitochondria are ejected to protect host cells 32 , 59 . Although the mechanisms and biological significance are unclear, mitochondrial components and tissue-specific RNAs could serve as candidate biomarkers to evaluate internal tissue responses in space, and potentially shed light on recent proposals that mitochondrial dysregulation is a central feature that accelerates spaceflight health risks 23 . SANS is present in some astronauts after short and long duration spaceflight 55 and is defined as a constellation of unusual clinical findings, including optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts 72 ."
Increasing the number of unloading/reambulation cycles does not adversely impac body composition and lumbar bone mineral density but reduces tissue sensitivity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747666/,"Within a 18wk period, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to one (1x-HLU), two (2x-HLU) or three (3x-HLU) cycles of 2 wk of hindlimb unloading (HLU) followed by 4 wk of reambulation (RA), or served as ambulatory age-matched controls. In vivo µCT longitudinally tracked changes in abdominal adipose and lean tissues, lumbar vertebral apparent volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area before and after the final HLU and RA cycle. Significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD were observed such that all unloaded animals reached similar values after the final unloading cycle. Irrespective of the number of HLU/RA cycles, total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different from age-matched controls after the final RA period.","While this greater potential for recovery may, at least in part, stem from the lesser overall decline in vertebral bone volume compared to the peripheral sites, differences in the HLU induced mechanical environment between the lumbar spine and the femur may have played a role. While atrophy tends to be greater in the plantar flexors and knee extensors following space flight and bed rest [ 2 ], direct comparisons are difficult because of the different measurement techniques and more detailed analysis on changes in muscle biology and function during multiple unloading/reloading periods will provide further insight. When combined with our results from the distal femur metaphysis [ 26 ], the differential ability of the lumbar vertebrae to recover from unloading induced bone loss is striking and may ultimately provide important cues towards the design of countermeasures that within the genetic constraints minimize bone loss and maximize recovery."
Bone shaft bending strength index is unaffected by exercise and unloading in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4337661/,"Abstract Anthropologists frequently use the shaft bending strength index to infer the physical activity levels of humans living in the past from their lower limb bone remains. Here, we report the results of two experiments that were designed to test the model within which anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. Similarly, stunted bone growth caused by unloading resulted in significantly diminished I max and I min compared with controls, but low activity did not lead to significantly decreased I max / I min compared with normal activity. Together, these results suggest that caution is required when the bone shaft bending strength index is used to reconstruct the activity levels of past humans.","If extrapolation of mouse data to humans is warranted, then the results of the two experiments presented here suggest that high- and low-activity lifestyles do not have the causal effects on the shaft bending strength index that are often assumed in anthropological analyses of human lower limb bone shaft structure (Ruff, 1987 ; Brock & Ruff, 1988 ; Larsen et al. First, the hypothesis that elliptically shaped bone shafts reflect high levels of physical activity is based on the premise that bone formation primarily takes place in the plane that bones engender peak mechanical stresses and strains; and the results of certain experiments with animal models in which in vivo strains were directly related to patterns of bone growth support this assumption. ( 2007 ), although engagement in the exercise regimen did not significantly alter the lower limb bone shaft bending strength index, across the entire study population (i.e. exercise participants and controls), weak but significant positive correlations were detected between the number of daily impacts (measured by accelerometer) and changes in femoral and tibial I max / I min throughout the course of the study."
Focal enhancement of the skeleton to exercise correlates to mesenchymal stem cell responsivity rather than peak external forces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631774/,"As importantly, the degree to which any given bone can adapt to functional challenges may be enabled, or constrained, by regional variation in the capacity of marrow progenitors to differentiate into bone-forming cells. Specifically, in the forelimb, where external forces generated by running were highest, exercise failed to augment diaphyseal structure in either the humerus or radius, nor did it affect humeral trabecular structure. Finally, using flow cytometry, we show that marrow-derived MSCs in the femur are more responsive to exercise-induced loads than humeral cells, such that running significantly lowered MSC populations only in the femur. Together, these data suggest that the ability of the progenitor population to differentiate toward osteoblastogenesis may correlate better with bone structural adaptation than peak external forces caused by exercise.","Second, these data indicate that MSCs in the humerus were less responsive to mechanical signals, either because of reduced cellular mechanosensitivity per se ( Volk et al., 2012 ), or perhaps due to aspects of the marrow niche (e.g. adjacency to hematopoietic stem cells, higher concentration of adipocytes, marrow viscosity) that confounded the ability of MSCs to commit to an osteoblast lineage ( Adler et al., 2014 ; Metzger et al., 2015 ). Thus, evolution of bone adaptability can be expected to have involved some degree of fine-tuning of responsivity across different skeletal locations in order to achieve site-specific compromises between maintaining equilibrium mechanical conditions while still ensuring that bones preserve optimal structure for their respective functional roles ( Lieberman and Crompton, 1998 ; Currey, 2002 ; Lieberman et al., 2003 ). Ultimately, this study supplies evidence (albeit preliminary) that the MSC, the cell that must be recruited to form bone, may be differentially responsive to mechanical signals, either because of variation in cellular mechanosensitivity or because the niche in which it resides is influencing the ability of the progenitor to commit to a particular tissue lineage."
"Cytoskeletal configuration modulates mechanically induced changes in mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis, morphology, and stiffness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052530/,"Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) responding to mechanical cues generated by physical activity is critical for skeletal development and remodeling. Here, we utilized low intensity vibrations (LIV) as a physiologically relevant mechanical signal and hypothesized that the confined cytoskeletal configuration imposed by 2D culture will enable human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSC) to respond more robustly when LIV is applied in-plane (horizontal-LIV) rather than out-of-plane (vertical-LIV). Our results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell’s response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of intracellular forces. Transcriptional and structural changes in particular with horizontal LIV, together with the strong frequency dependency of the signal, emphasize the importance of intracellular cytoskeletal configuration in sensing and responding to high-frequency mechanical signals at low intensities.","As MSC mechanosensitivity increases with LIV bouts 13 , the temporal increase in Nesprin-2 and LaminA/C expression may suggest an increased nucleo-cytoskeletal connectivity that may, at least in part, contribute to a more potent MSC mechanoresponse with long-term LIV treatment. Considering that both ACTN1 and CDH11 were more highly upregulated in h-LIV groups in which cytoskeletal orientation aligned with the loading axis, the concomitant increase in these two proteins by h-LIV may suggest a coordinated effort towards regulating cellular alignment and cell-to-cell interaction. Identification of cellular elements involved in sensing and responding to extremely low levels of mechanical signals may prove critical towards developing effective mechanically based musculoskeletal treatments without side-effects."
Genetic and tissue level muscle-bone interactions during unloading and reambulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114340/,"Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed.","While these data emphasize the strong influence of genetic variations on the response of both skeletal muscle and bone, the low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response, are inconsistent with the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-regulates its size during mechanical challenges. Second, we chose the composite cross-sectional muscle area of several individual muscles as we assumed that the forces exerted by these muscles are primarily responsible for inducing bone strains in the diaphysis (and metaphysis) of the mouse femur and because the µCT images did not allow for separation into distinct muscle groups. Using the initial adaptive changes in both tissues upon application of a new mechanical environment ostensibly provided the largest signals for the correlations and should have also minimized the limitation that changes in muscle and bone were quantified simultaneously, rather than sequentially with muscle measurements preceding bone measurements."
Osteocyte apoptosis caused by hindlimb unloading is required to trigger osteocyte RANKL production and subsequent resorption of cortical and trabecular bone in mice femurs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488280/,"Abstract Osteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse.","A focal injury mechanism can readily explain increased osteocyte apoptosis at bone micro-damage sites, whereas the regional localization of osteocyte apoptosis after ovariectomy appears to reflect the combination of oxidative stress from estrogen loss superimposed on older osteocytes that are found in characteristic locations in mouse diaphyseal cortical bone. ( 54 – 56 ) Indeed, the presence of elevated osteocyte apoptosis in all anatomical regions suggests a uniform, distributed stress in bone resulting from disuse, whereas the greater number of apoptotic osteocytes near the endocortical surface in disuse may suggest that these osteocytes are more in need of growth factors and survival cytokines than those further deep in the bone matrix. First, different classes of drugs were used to inhibit osteocyte apoptosis; we used a well-established pan-caspase inhibitor, ( 19 , 22 , 39 , 40 ) which showed no effects on RANKL gene expression and osteoclastogenesis in our in vitro studies, whereas Plotkin and colleagues employed a novel bisphosphonate with anti-apoptotic properties."
Differential Single Cell Responses of Embryonic Stem Cells Versus Embryoid Bodies to Gravity Mechanostimulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9293686/,"In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters.","Our study demonstrated that a 60-min HG pulse in day 9 EBs results in limited divergence in cell type assignment and transcriptomic signature from traditional static culture EBs. Embryo development studies varying gravity environment in murine models have shown that stage of gestation when the gravity disturbance is applied is critical. These studies collectively suggesting a potential gravity regulated DDR pathway that may play a role in regulating how developmental cells respond to DNA damage, critical for the cell transition from pre- to post-implantation and gestation success. Additionally, ESCs recovered from the parabolic gravity loading then cultured as EBs for a further 12 days showed elevated Gene Ontology/ Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways associated with skeletal, respiratory, blood vessels, liver, and nervous system and suppression of cardiac development pathways."
Macrophages inhibit Aspergillus fumigatus germination and neutrophil-mediated fungal killing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6091969/,"Abstract In immunocompromised individuals, Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive fungal disease that is often difficult to treat. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection.","However, healthy humans inhale spores of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus from the environment every day without becoming sick, and how the immune system clears this infection is still obscure. Larval zebrafish allow for visualization of fungal growth and innate immune cell behavior in live, intact animals. Our experiments underline different mechanisms of virulence that pathogens can utilize—rapid growth versus dormancy and persistence—and inform future strategies for fighting fungal infections in susceptible immunocompromised patients."
Contributions of spore secondary metabolites to UV-C protection and virulence vary in different Aspergillus fumigatus strains,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029147/,"Conidia (asexual spores) of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus synthesize several metabolites, including melanin, which has been reported to be important for virulence in this species and to be protective against UV radiation in other fungi. fumigatus and find variability in its ability to protect spores from UV-C radiation or impact virulence in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis in two clinical strains and one ISS strain.

We had thought that trypacidin loss would result in increased sensitivity to UV-C, as several of its precursors (e.g., emodin and questin) are pigmented anthraquinones that have been shown to protect Xanthoria elegans and Cetraria islandica against UV ( 42 , 64 )."
Regulation of hemocytes in Drosophila requires dappled cytochrome b5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092937/,"Abstract A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function.","They investigated processing of hydroxylamines, which are oxidative products of arylamine drugs and environmental carcinogens, by the mutant cytochrome b5 of one heterozygous individual and found, in vitro, altered affinity for hydroxylamine substrates and dramatically reduced cytochrome b5 expression (Kurian et al. Rescue of the plasmatocyte increase in dappled heterozygotes is expected to result from the hemese - Gal4 expression in circulating blood cells of the first hematopoietic wave, both because of the age of the larvae (prerelease of lymph gland cells) and because hemese - Gal4 does not express in lymph glands. More specifically, a candidate to mediate the effects of dappled is TNF-receptor associated factor 6 (Traf6), which is predicted from protein studies to interact with cytochrome b5 (Drosophila Interactions Database, http://www.droidb.org )."

A study of gravitropism in the roots of rice ( Oryza sativa, Poaceae) used variable densities of an external media to exert more or less force on root tissue without changing statolith sedimentation rate, resulting in changes in gravitropic response ( Staves et al., 1997b ). Further experiments performed on ground-based facilities for microgravity simulation, including sequential sampling at different growth times and the analysis of gene expression, have confirmed the uncoupling of cell proliferation and ribosome biogenesis caused by altered gravity, showing that the weightlessness environment is a stress condition for plant proliferating cells. Moreover, the nucleolar protein nucleolin, which activates ribosome biogenesis in connection to mechanisms of cell cycle regulation, is induced by glucose and sucrose ( Kojima et al., 2007 ) Thus, the light signal perceived by leaves is transmitted by photosynthesis-derived sugars to the root meristem, where they activate cell cycle via different pathways, such as the TOR-E2FA. Furthermore, it was shown that a red-light pulse given to dark-grown seedlings resulted in increasing the cell proliferation activity (i.e., the mitotic index) and in the expression of some relevant nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, and in particular, of a nucleolin-like nucleolar protein gene, indicating an increase in the rate of production of ribosomes in the nucleolus ( Tong et al., 1997 ; Reichler et al., 2001 ; Figure 3 )."

Comparative transcriptomics indicate changes in cell wall organization and stress response in seedlings during spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5821596/,"The bioinformatics methods used included RMA (robust multi-array average), MAS5 (Microarray Suite 5.0), and PLIER (probe logarithmic intensity error estimation). KEY RESULTS In our BRIC-16 experiments, we noted expression changes in genes involved in hypoxia and heat shock responses, DNA repair, and cell wall structure between spaceflight samples compared to the ground controls. Comparing our studies to those of the other BRIC-16 experiments demonstrated that, even with the same hardware and similar biological materials, differences in results in gene expression were found among these spaceflight experiments. In addition, all three studies found differential regulation of genes associated with cell wall remodeling and stress responses between spaceflight-grown and ground control plants.","Cell wall components have previously been shown to be dependent on environmental growth conditions and are specific to each plant organ, with roots and leaves differing in composition in response to moisture availability ( Pattathil et al., 2016 ). The glycomics results of our BRIC-16-Cyt study confirmed these previous studies, as they indicated that many xylan and pectic backbone epitopes were marginally less abundant in spaceflight-grown plants vs. Since there were abundant adventitious roots observed on the hypocotyls of spaceflight seedlings compared with ground controls, some of the differences in expression profiles may be accounted for by including root tissues ( Millar et al., 2011 )."
RNAseq analysis of the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to fractional gravity under blue-light stimulation during spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6889863/,"The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions. Materials and Methods: Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro- g , several intermediate partial- g levels, and 1 g , and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g -level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low- g , and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g -level. Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity.","Interestingly, the effect of blue-light illumination is clearly observable in the microgravity samples, with a clear enrichment in GO terms related with light perception, photosynthesis and biosynthesis of the photosynthetic complexes as previously reported ( Vandenbrink et al., 2019 ), but it is barely appearing in the GO enrichment analyses that we performed on partial gravity samples, even bellow 0.1 g (low g conditions). Similarly, it is important to take into account the existence of hardware effects when growing plants in real microgravity ( Kiss, 2015 ), including lack of convection, reduced CO 2 levels, improper temperature, elevated ethylene, spacecraft vibrations, increased radiation exposure, among others. These results are consistent with previous data coming from partial gravity simulation paradigms that validated that Arabidopsis developmental plan is still affected at the Moon g -level (even more intensely affected than in similar simulated microgravity samples) but that the “normal” developmental plan is almost completely restored at Mars g -levels ( Kamal et al., 2018 ; Manzano et al., 2018 )."
Comparison of Microgravity Analogs to Spaceflight in Studies of Plant Growth and Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6908503/,"One method of eliminating gravity'’s influence is to enter into a free-fall orbit around the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal force of the moving object. In addition to actually compensating gravity, instruments such as clinostats, random-positioning machines (RPM), and magnetic levitation devices have been used to eliminate effects of constant gravity on plant growth and development. While these analogs are useful, the fidelity of the results relative to spaceflight depends on biological parameters and environmental conditions that cannot be simulated in ground-based studies. Keywords: Arabidopsis , clinostat, plant growth, simulated microgravity, random positioning machine, reduced gravity, spaceflight experiments","The experiments to date suggest that while these devices may be useful tools in some cases, there are great differences observed between plants that grow and develop on these devices and plants that are grown in weightlessness during spaceflight. The conditions under which ground-based simulation can provide useful information and compare various gravitational regimens need to be systematically determined through carefully controlled experiments in which ground analog studies are compared with spaceflight experiments. For example, in plant studies, factors to consider include identical seed stock, growth substrate, nutrient media, and light composition and intensity."
The importance of Earth reference controls in spaceflight-omics research: Characterization of nucleolin mutants from the Seedling Growth experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607443/,"Spaceflight produces deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light. Here, in a series of ground studies, we have used mutants from the two Arabidopsis nucleolin genes ( NUC1 and NUC2, nucleolar regulators of ribosome biogenesis) to better understand their role in adaptive response mechanisms to stress on Earth. Thus, we show that nucleolin stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate for the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, whereas nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light. These ground control findings, as part of the ESA/NASA Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments, will determine the basis for the identification of genetic backgrounds enabling an adaptive advantage for plants in future space experiments.","Spaceflight produces deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light.

Conducting plant experiments in space and on the Moon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10764921/,"Abstract Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “ water lentils ” or “ duckweed ”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions.","This possible positive response to hypergravity treatments opens up interesting possibilities for future studies and potential applications in space agriculture but requires new ad hoc tests, eventually applying higher levels of hypergravity to amplify the phenomenon. The robust growth and adaptability to altered gravity conditions can be added to the small size, rapid growth rate, and high nutrient content, confirming that this genus deserves consideration for cultivation in limited space and resource-constrained environments 7 . Testing the effects of altered gravity on only one clone of Wolffia globosa , as done in our experiment, provides a valuable starting point but may not fully capture the entire range of responses within the genus Wolffia ."
Red light enhances plant adaptation to spaceflight and Mars g-levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9605285/,"Deleterious effects of the space environment on plant development have been reported, such as the unbalance of cell growth and proliferation in the root meristem, or gene expression reprogramming. In spaceflight seedlings illuminated for 4 days with a white light photoperiod and then photostimulated with red light for 2 days, transcriptomic studies showed, first, that red light partially reverted the gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, and that the combination of microgravity and photoactivation was not recognized by seedlings as stressful. Further transcriptomic studies at different g -levels showed elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression in microgravity, associated with disturbed nucleus–organelle communication, and the upregulation of genes encoding auxin and cytokinin hormonal pathways. At the Mars g -level, genes of hormone pathways related to stress response were activated, together with some transcription factors specifically related to acclimation, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial- g are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes related to space-environment-associated stress.","Among the key findings of our spaceflight project are the new results on phototropism induced by red and blue light illumination, the effect of red light illumination in counteracting the adverse effects of altered gravity, and the discovery that Moon gravity could trigger more severe transcriptomic responses than spaceflight. However, we also observed that Mars gravity is capable of inducing the gravitropic orientation of roots, and the different responses to the space environment of the various mutants used, suggesting that the selection of plants for their culture in alien environments should require prior detailed analysis of their genotypes in order to select the varieties capable of adapting better. NASA is actively promoting plant studies on the ISS using the aforementioned spaceflight incubators Veggie, APH, and X-ROOTS, but this activity is basically oriented to nutritional aspects, without giving the necessary priority to fundamental studies at cellular and molecular level."
EUK-134 ameliorates nNOS¬µ translocation and skeletal muscle fiber atrophy during short-term mechanical unloading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3962621/,"Abstract Reduced mechanical loading during bedrest, spaceflight, and casting, causes rapid morphological changes in skeletal muscle: fiber atrophy and reduction of slow-twitch fibers. We used EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOSμ translocation and muscle fiber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers.","In this study, EUK-134, a mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, attenuated the mechanical unloading or “spaceflight phenotype” in skeletal muscle in the hindlimb-unloading ground model: muscle fiber atrophy and slow-twitch to fast-twitch fiber-type shift. Therefore, protection against FoxO3a dephosphorylation at Thr-32 by EUK-134 is consistent with a pathway, whereby oxidative stress participates in translocation of nNOS with mechanical unloading, directly leading to FoxO3a activation, as well as increased proteolysis through ubiquitin ligases (e.g., MuRF-1), leading to fiber atrophy ( 42 ). In summary, translocation of nNOSμ during short-term mechanical unloading in the rat soleus was reduced by the SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134 and linked to protection against muscle fiber atrophy and fiber-type shift from slow to fast."
MnSOD Overexpression Reduces Fibrosis and Pro-Apoptotic Signaling in the Aging Mouse Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462657/,"Abstract Contractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers accumulate. We recently reported that exercise training elevates Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the aging heart, concomitant with reduction in oxidative stress and fibrosis. Age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis was mitigated in MnSOD Tg mice with reductions in extramyocyte space (−65%), collagen-I, and transforming growth factor-β. Pro-apoptotic markers Bax (−38%) and caspase-3 cleavage (−41%) were reduced and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei, DNA laddering) was mitigated in MnSOD Tg hearts compared with old wild-type.","In addition, enhancement of MnSOD proteins levels in Sod2 Tg mice protected against age-related increase of pro-apoptotic signaling (eg, Bax, cleaved caspase-3) and apoptosis (eg, TUNEL-positive nuclei, DNA fragmentation) in the LVs of mouse hearts. Although the mechanisms underlying reduced oxidative stress with MnSOD overexpression are not fully delineated, it is logical that reduced levels of mitochondrial superoxide in the old Tg mice may protect against lipid peroxide and radical formation via suppressing Haber-Weiss or Fenton reactions. In this study, we observed that MnSOD overexpression substantially reduced levels of TGF-β1 ( Figure 5 ) and collagen-I ( Figure 4 ) in the aging LV of OTg mice versus age-matched WTs. These finding support the hypothesis that MnSOD is involved in inhibitory regulation of TGF-β1 and cardiac fibrosis."
Lifelong wheel running exercise and mild caloric restriction attenuate nuclear EndoG in the aging plantaris muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026643/,"Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. These data indicate that CR and WR with CR attenuate age-associated upregulation of EndoG translocation in the nucleus, potentially involved with HSP27 signaling.","Although some preclinical studies have also implicated caspase-independent EndoG translocation and apoptosis in aging skeletal muscle ( Gouspillou and others 2014 ; Marzetti and others 2012 ), the physiological relevance of caspase-independent EndoG pathways associated with muscle mass/size/function and physical performance further need to be established. However, we could not directly compare the caspase-independent EndoG pathways with muscle cell morphology, mitochondrial function and physical functions due to small sample size, tissue limitation, and the lack of the functional parameter data, which make our finding highly relevant. The positive effects of mild caloric restriction and voluntary lifelong wheel running exercise with caloric restriction on EndoG in aging muscle are exciting, and suggest the potential for protective, regulatory upstream pathways, including chaperone proteins capable of inactivating apoptosis."
Age-related alterations in the sarcolemmal environment are attenuated by lifelong caloric restriction and voluntary exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026642/,"Abstract Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris.","In the current study, we report that lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and CR plus lifelong voluntary wheel running (WR) are interventions capable of partially preventing the age-associated decrease in plantaris muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA). If muscle fiber cross-sectional area is decreased and fiber number is reduced with aging due to apoptosis ( Marzetti and others 2008 ), then extracellular matrix of connective tissue and fat must compromise a larger proportion of aging muscle mass ( Kim and others 2008 ). 4.2. Protection by CR and CRWR against DGC alterations in aged plantaris muscle The costameric DGC acts as a mechanosensitive scaffold of proteins that are responsible for force transmission, structural integrity of the cell, and transmission of cellular signaling processes from the extracellular environment ( Grounds and others 2005 ; Gumerson and Michele 2011 )."
"The impact of SRT2104 on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, redox biology, and loss of muscle mass in hindlimb unloaded rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10342025/,"The elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy. Mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions (10 days): ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded-treated with SRT2104 (SIRT). In the gastrocnemius, (1) integrative (per mg tissue) proton LEAK was lesser in SIRT than in HU or CON; (2) intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase) maximal noncoupled electron transfer capacity (E CI+II ) was lesser, while complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to E CI+II was greater in HU than CON; (3) the contribution of LEAK to E CI+II was greatest, but cytochrome c oxidase activity was lowest in HU. These results indicate that SRT2104 preserves mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle, suggesting its potential to support healthy muscle cells in microgravity by promoting necessary energy production in mitochondria.","However, proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane results in a decrease in the proton gradient that is generated by the electron transfer system and less protons being utilized in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production for cellular energy. In the current study, despite greater H 2 O 2 production within rats treated with SRT2104 compared to control rats, production did not exceed 5 pmol·min −1 ·mg −1 protein; thus, it may be possible that this elevation in H 2 O 2 production was not significant enough to perpetuate oxidative damage. Previous investigations have reported reduced cross-sectional area, a dramatic decrease in total protein, and a decrease in total succinate dehydrogenase activity (activity × cross-sectional area) of both slow- and fast-twitch fibers in the soleus muscle following spaceflight and microgravity [ 40 ]."
Bioreactor development for skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy by manipulating uniaxial cyclic strain: Proof of concept.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167039/,"Abstract Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.","In contrast, withdrawal and cessation of cyclic stretch resulted in substantial atrophy on myotube diameter, concomitant with reduced Akt phosphorylation, and elevation of catabolic, pro-inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-1ß, IL-6, NF-kappaB subunit p65) as well as proteolytic signaling (e.g., reduced FoxO3a phosphorylation/total FoxO3a ratio, elevated total FoxO3a). The FlexCell®’s 2 days cyclic stretching protocol (12%, 0.7 Hz,1 h/d) using collagen-coated plates increased myotube diameter, talin levels, Akt phosphorylation activity, and FoxO3a phosphorylation leading to stretch-induced muscle hypertrophy and growth. In this study, we tested and developed an alternative bioreactor to mimic the effects of both overloading and microgravity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by imposing and withdrawing periods of cyclic tensile strain, using a StrexCell uniaxial stretch system."

CAMDLES: CFD-DEM Simulation of Microbial Communities in Spaceflight and Artificial Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9144607/,"Abstract We present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), an extension of CFDEM ® Coupling to model biological flows, growth, and mass transfer in artificial microgravity devices. Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.","Baseline diffusivities for each metabolite were set as constant in CAMDLES; we were able to change these values to explore differences between biofilm-like and non-biofilm situations, but such changes were global and, therefore, unable to reflect far-field effects outside of colonies within a larger liquid culture vessel. More work is necessary to determine whether our simulation domain size was large enough to capture the diffusion dynamics of metabolites; although it is large enough to contain a single colony, it did not consider all possible interactions with multiple colonies, except for the simplest, uniform interaction from choosing periodic boundary conditions. Generally, if Brownian motion and cell motility were included in the simulation, we would likely observe a reduction in the relative difference between microgravity and RWV growth rates, and an overall reduction in growth rates due to long-term biomass dispersion throughout the simulation domain."
Hardware validation of the Advanced Plant Habitat on ISS: Canopy photosynthesis in reduced gravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314936/,"APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. The validation test examined the APH’s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO 2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO 2 drawdown experiments).","No pre-flight testing was performed on the ground, thus design team recommended settings were used throughout the operation of the APH during the validation test. The ability to grow Arabidopsis stems, flowers and siliques was accomplished in 6 weeks and the APH’s ability to contain debris during harvest was demonstrated during harvest of the mature Arabidopsis plants. Environmental and non-destructive plant growth data was collected and used to validate the ability of APH to measure photosynthesis, respiration and CQY of a plant canopy during spaceflight."
Trimeric structure of (+)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein at 1.95 A resolution with three isolated active sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340379/,"Background: Dirigent protein (DP) discovery gave new paradigm for monolignol-derived coupling in planta. Results: (+)-Pinoresinol-forming DP (PsDRR206) three-dimensional structure was obtained at 1.95 Å resolution. Conclusion: The tightly packed trimeric DP has three putative substrate binding sites spatially far apart, suggesting that each site involves monomer coupling directly. Keywords: Crystallography, Homology Modeling, Molecular Docking, Protein Crystallization, Secondary Metabolism, Dirigent Proteins, Phenoxy Radical Radical Coupling","Several other conserved residues in DPs are also found buried in the trimer interface, supporting the idea that the trimer is the functional form of this and probably other DPs. Comparison of Amino Acid Sequences for DPs with Opposite Stereoselectivities and Homology Models of AtDIR6 In our earlier work ( 5 ) and that of others ( 11 ), homology models of ScDIR and AtDIR6, (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs, respectively, were made using the very distantly related AOC structures as potential templates. A seventh active site residue (Val 176 in PsDRR206), not included in the original set because it is substituted with Thr in one (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, becomes Met in (−)-pinoresinol-forming DPs. These residues are located opposite each another on either side of the pocket, in the center of one or the other of the two highly curved antiparallel β-sheets that form the β-barrel. Although this is in conceptual agreement with our earlier considerations of DPs and proteins harboring dirigent (substrate binding) sites/domains for lignan biosynthesis and lignification ( 8 , 40 ), respectively, it must be emphasized that most DPs still await discovery of their true physiological functions, as well as in terms of chemical structural and in vitro function analyses."
Reduced Arogenate Dehydratase Expression: Ramifications for Photosynthesis and Metabolism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933128/,"Modulation of arogenate dehydratase in Arabidopsis causes changes in secondary metabolism, transient overaccumulation of starch, and lower photosynthetic electron transport rates.","In this way, reduced phenylpropanoid biosynthesis can be envisaged to have two interconnected consequences for photosynthesis: (1) reduced consumption of fixed carbon by the Calvin-Benson cycle, leading to an increase in transitory starch; and (2) lowered consumption of ATP, leading to slightly lower electron transport rates via an increase in the feedback regulation of qE. This pleiotropic effect (i.e. when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits) is nevertheless consistent with previous research suggesting possible cross talk between glucosinolate and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways ( Hemm et al., 2003 ; Kim et al., 2015 ; Mach, 2015 ).

New insights into lignification via network and multi-omics analyses of arogenate dehydratase knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185232/,"Abstract Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase ( ADT ) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models in situ , with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants.","Venn diagrams which depict the overlap between proteins and transcripts revealed that (a) most transcripts detected did not correspond to a detectable protein, likely due to dynamic range and sampling limits of the proteomics technology compared to the depth of coverage capable with RNA-Seq and (b) not all proteins detected corresponded to a detectable transcript ( Figure 2 ) as could arise from differential mRNA and protein degradation rates. Network Analysis Reveals Lignin/Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis Associated Proteins Network analysis is a powerful tool for understanding systems biology effects, drawing from known and predicted direct (physical) and indirect (functional) interactions from multiple data and literature sources.

Functional consequences of radiation-induced oxidative stress in cultured neural stem cells and the brain exposed to charged particle irradiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936501/,"Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Data suggest that astronauts subjected to space radiation may develop a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing long-term neurocognitive sequelae.","Past work from our lab has characterized the radiation response of multipotent neural cells grown as monolayers to high and low LET radiation, and has shown that following irradiation these cells exhibit a marked rise in acute and persistent oxidative stress that is associated with increased apoptosis, an inhibition of cell cycle progression, and marked radiosensitivity ( 25 , 32 , 33 ). Thus, while the complexity of the intracellular redox chemistry precludes direct assignment of fluorescent signals derived from oxidized dyes to specific reactive species or their sites of production, our data does suggest that irradiation elicits an overall imbalance in redox homeostasis that promotes a persistent oxidative stress in irradiated cells. Neurocognitive tasks dependent on other nonhippocampal areas of the brain are also altered after heavy ion exposure ( 4 , 5 , 34 ), as exposure to low doses of iron ions was found to impair the ability of rats to conduct attentional set-shifting, suggesting deficits in executive function ( 34 )."

Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space missions.","Interestingly, our findings here suggest that any negative influence of spaceflight on OB volume and neurogenesis may be prevented or mitigated by exposure to a novel sensory environment, as provided by AEMs. Supporting this conclusion, we show that AEM-Ground mice had ∼25% larger OB relative to Vivarium and AEM-Flight mice. Collectively, these earlier studies resemble our current findings in which the sensory environment of the AEMs may promote activity-dependent survival in AEM-Ground mice, and to a lesser extent neuroblast differentiation, both processes that are not observed in AEM-Flight mice, likely due to stressors in the space environment. As our current findings suggest a protective effect of a novel environment on OB volume and neurogenesis, increasing cell survival could be a strategy to mitigate the negative effects of spaceflight for other at-risk CNS regions, and consequently enhance crew performance during long-term interplanetary missions."
"Effects of low-dose rate Œ≥-irradiation combined with simulated microgravity on markers of oxidative stress, DNA methylation potential, and remodeling in the mouse heart",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5498037/,"Immunoblot analysis, rt-PCR, high-performance liquid chromatography, and histology were used to assess inflammatory cell infiltration, cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, and the methylation potential of cardiac tissue in 3 to 6 animals per group. While manganese superoxide dismutase protein levels decreased 9 months after low-dose γ-radiation, no changes were observed in expression of catalase or Nrf2, a transcription factor that determines the expression of several antioxidant enzymes, at the measured endpoints. Conclusions This study has provided the first and relatively broad analysis of small molecule and protein markers of oxidative stress, T-lymphocyte infiltration, and cardiac remodeling in response to HU with simultaneous exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. However, further research is needed with larger numbers of animals for a more robust statistical power to fully characterize the early and late effects of simulated microgravity combined with exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation on the heart.","The data in our current study extend the finding of Sridharan et al., who used an animal model of high-dose local heart irradiation [ 39 ], by demonstrating that the GSH:GSSG ratio is sensitive to γ-radiation at a whole body, total low-dose of 0.04 Gy. Our data do not show a greater decrement in GSH:GSSG following 1 month of normal ambulation post-HU and no significant differences in GSH:GSSG ratios between groups were observed 9 months after treatment. These data suggest that a decrease in left ventricular GSH:GSSG ratios [ 39 ] results from an exposure to simulated microgravity or to low-dose/dose-rate γ-radiation, and that the combination of simulated microgravity and γ-irradiation produces a greater affect than either insult alone, measured up to one month after treatment. While the current study did not produce a change in mast cell numbers within the mouse heart after 4 months, we did observe a small but significant increase in mast cell tryptase protein content 9 months after low-dose γ-irradiation or a combination of HU + γ-irradiation by immunoblotting, which is likely a more sensitive measure to indicate the presence of mast cells compared to mast cell counts in histological analysis."
Characterization of mouse ocular response to a 35-day spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6547757/,"The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals.","Additionally, during 30 days of spaceflight on the Bion-M1 satellite, mean arterial blood pressure in the aortic arch of mice is not altered 34 , and arteries in the head and hindlimbs of mice flown on the Bion-M1 and Space Shuttle do not show any structural remodeling to indicate chronic changes in fluid pressure associated with a cephalad fluid shift 26 , 27 , 35 . Results from the current paper are in agree with this previous study that spaceflight induces significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells and some proteins and pathways associated with cell death, inflammation and metabolic stress were significantly altered following spaceflight Additionally, the current finding examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced changes and provide strong evidence that spaceflight impacts BRB integrity. Multiple factors could be responsible for the changes observed in the FLT mice, including 35 days of weightlessness, increased radiation exposure, and distress associated with live return through the Earth’s atmosphere, splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, transport to the LLU laboratory, and approximately 38 hours of re-exposure to Earth’s gravity."
Mice Exposed to Combined Chronic Low-Dose Irradiation and Modeled Microgravity Develop Long-Term Neurological Sequelae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6747492/,"This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). In contrast, following combined HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late onset neurological sequelae.","Mid/hindbrain sections were assessed to localize the transcriptional profile to a region that is central to neurogenesis (hippocampus) and hypothalamic–pituitary axis (HPA) responses, in order to better assess neurofunctional output without potential contamination from the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. In line with this, the induction of aquaporins may be linked to neuroinflammation [ 20 , 21 , 22 ], while the upregulation of additional immune activation markers including Cd74 , H2-Ab1, C1ql2 and Ifit-3 were also identified in combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, along with hypomethylated Cfi and Mx1 , collectively suggesting chronic neuroinflammation may persist during brain readaptation post-combined HLU+LDR exposure. Thus, brain-related transcriptional changes are dynamic and plastic during readaptation from exposure to spaceflight-like conditions, and while these exposures may lead to long-term neurological consequences, the active processes of neuroplasticity and repair are engaged to maintain neural homeostasis."
"Spaceflight influences gene expression, photoreceptor integrity, and oxidative stress-related damage in the murine retina.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6746706/,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.","Our results indicate that in addition to Arabidopsis thaliana , there may be splice isoform alterations in mammals during spaceflight as well that should be explored in future work and included in the risk assessment for long duration space missions. Furthermore, the literature does not report any of the DETFs directly related to retinitis pigmentosa, which could indicate that these genes, although not yet described, could have a role in retinitis pigmentosa or that they are part of spaceflight specific expression network that can be explored as biomarkers and/or drug targets. Although no cure is currently known, supplementation with certain minerals and vitamins, especially vitamin A, has been demonstrated to delay the disease progression 48 and should be considered a possible countermeasure to spaceflight induced retinal damage."
Evaluating ocular response in the retina and optic nerve head after single and fractionated high-energy protons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400407/,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). Keywords: space radiation, protons, mouse retina, optic nerve head, blood-retinal barrier, fractionation dose, apoptosis, oxidative stress","This study demonstrated that 0.5 Gy of proton radiation induced significant changes in oxidative stress, apoptosis, and BRB integrity biomarkers in the mouse retina four months after a dose of 0.5 Gy. There were differential responses between single and fractionated dose schedules in several parameters. In the current study, the decrease in ZO-1 protein expression in the retina together with the increase in water channel protein AQP-4 and adhesion molecules PECAM-1, in conjunction with increased apoptosis, suggests the BRB disturbance and prolonged tissue remodeling due to radiation exposure with single or fractionated dose schedules. Our long-term goal is to use system biology approach to investigate the association between ophthalmic changes and other organs pathologies in response to ionizing radiation and to facilitate a better understanding of space radiation-induced tissues response and its relationship to health implication that may lead to disease development."
Characterization of gene expression profiles in the mouse brain after 35 days of spaceflight mission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9365836/,"The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoString TM ) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.","Previous study has shown that inflammation induced loss of inhibitory nerve terminals or a redistribution of presynaptic machinery in inhibitory neurons may increase risk for developing neurological disease and psychiatric illness, including seizures and schizophrenia 39 .

A multi-omics longitudinal study of the murine retinal response to chronic low-dose irradiation and simulated microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9547011/,"We assessed a multi-omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months post-exposure.

A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post-exposure stages.","However, even with the inherent limitations of using analogs, the observed results still provide insights on processes related to retinal dysfunction due to individual and combined exposures, at different time points, allowing us to gain a preliminary understanding of longitudinal changes.

Ground-based low-dose gamma or x-ray radiation studies are often used to study the effect of space-relevant radiation exposures (in terms of total dose) on different tissues/systems 6 , 47 , 48 as to inform future space radiation experiments and form an initial understanding of the impacts across radiation doses and types."
Evidence of spaceflight-induced adverse effects on photoreceptors and retinal function in the mouse eye.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10138634/,"Abstract The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. These data indicate that spaceflight conditions induce oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell damage and retinal function impairment.","Adding BuOE, a lipophilic metalloporphyrin compound with high potency for the catalysis of lipid peroxidation reduced immunoreactivity of the biomarker in the BuOE-treated ocular tissue compared to the flight saline group, suggesting a potential mechanism of oxidative stress in inducing cellular damage. Administration of BuOE had limited effects in attenuating spaceflight-induced retinal functional change assessed by ERG recording, although it was more effective in restoring a-wavet responses than b-wave responses, especially at high flash intensity ( Figure 3 b). Another plausible explanation is that spaceflight conditions induced an imbalanced oxidative/antioxidative homeostasis and antioxidant defense enhanced by this redox-active compound may lead to apoptotic pathway regulation and recovery of retinal function at a later time."
Effects of spaceflight on the brain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12031868/,"This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.","These gravity-dependent alterations in the spindle rate: joint angle relation lead the participant to perceive their arms in positions which are unexpected and therefore makes them unsure of the reliability of their movements when these are made in the absence of vision. When hypergravity imposes extra torque on the joint, the activation angle will be moved further towards the middle of the movement range, increasing the opportunity for mixing, thereby raising the joint receptor component of the position signal. The three methods of measurement used in the present study seem to show a progressive transition between these two influences; from one which relies almost entirely on peripheral afferent information, two-arm matching, to one that contains elements of both peripheral and central influences, one-arm pointing, to one which is concerned predominantly with central sources of information, repositioning."

This study will serve as a reference point for future commercial and non-commercial spaceflight, low Earth orbit (LEO) missions, and deep-space exploration.","The NASA Twins Study was the first to report spaceflight-specific telomere elongation in humans, with one astronaut experiencing telomere elongation during his one-year mission, rapid telomere shortening upon return to Earth, and telomere length recovery to near pre-flight baseline values over the following months, although many more short telomeres after spaceflight than before were also observed [ 3 ]. Extending the analysis to future missions and continuous longitudinal tracking for years post-flight could shed more light on the long-term consequences of spaceflight in relation to its altitude and duration, or for low VAF alleles, as well as repeated exposure of astronauts to space radiation. A 12-year ISS immune data comparison indicated improvements in immunity, stress, and viral reactivation due to operational and biomedical countermeasures onboard ISS, such as resupply frequency, improvements in personal communication, exercise equipment, and food quality and variety, suggesting the potential for improved quality of life on the health of astronauts [ 40 ]."

Molecular and physiologic changes in the SpaceX Inspiration4 civilian crew,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11357997/,"In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling. Here we report the primary findings from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of long-term spaceflight 2 , but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts 3 , which can inform countermeasure development for both private and government-sponsored space missions.","Conversely, the ocular imaging procedure (most intricate), which required precise gaze control and accurate probe manipulation by real-time visual feedback, did not produce image sets of sufficient quality to derive the intended measures, such as globe axial length or optic nerve sheath diameter. Based on these findings, as well as those acquired during similar applications on the ISS, ocular imaging with JIT instruction in future missions should involve a dedicated ultrasound operator; however, other exams can be reliably performed in self-scanning, autonomous mode, which represents a significant medical and research capability in situations with degraded communications (for example, high latency, loss of communication). These data also include qualitative survey data received via mobile apps, DICOM-standard images from portable ultrasound devices, data from wearables (for example, heart rate, electrocardiogram), biospecimen information, cell processing details 48 and the environmental/mission data from the Crew Dragon capsule (for example, cabin pressure, temperature and humidity, spacecraft telemetry), which can help guide exploration-class future missions 49 ."
Telomeric RNA (TERRA) increases in response to spaceflight and high-altitude climbing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167063/,"Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive tumors.","In light of TERRA’s emerging roles in DNA damage and cellular stress responses 39 , we speculated that TERRA might play a role in ionizing radiation and/or telomeric DDRs. To test this, we investigated telomeric RNA, or TERRA, levels in astronauts experiencing the low dose/low dose-rate space radiation environment and in ground-based high-altitude climbers of Mt. Everest (normal human blood in vivo), as well as in normal human PBMCs exposed to simulated microgravity, and in human U2OS (ALT) cells utilizing in vitro radiation exposures and the chimeric EN-T telomeric DSB targeting system 62 , 63 , 68 . Bearing in mind that U2OS cells experience a defective G1 checkpoint due to truncated WIP1 (wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1) and p16 deficiency (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor) 89 , and further that the HR proteins RAD51 and RAD52 have been shown to be required for TERRA interactions at telomeres 40 , 88 , we employed a Geminin-GFP/EdU based strategy as per our previous 63 to determine cell cycle profiles of interphase nuclei experiencing telomeric DSBs. Positively transfected EN-T and TRF1-only cells accumulated in G2-phase, consistent with a DNA damage/telomeric DSB-induced G2 block. Moreover, and consistent with recent evidence that increased TERRA transcription and associated ALT-like mechanisms pose a threat to telomere integrity so must be properly controlled in normal cells 107 , our results also support the possibility of targeting telomeric RNA/TERRA-mediated protection and repair of damaged telomeres associated with high dose radiation therapy 78 as a promising therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive cancers."
Spatial multi-omics of human skin reveals KRAS and inflammatory responses to spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166909/,"Abstract Spaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear.

These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints.","KRAS has many roles across three key cell types, including: (1) endothelial cells (i.e., mechanotransduction pathways and integrin-associated events 58 ), (2) fibroblast reprogramming (i.e., inflammatory gene expression and tissue extracellular signaling effectors, which polarizes immune populations while preventing tissue repair 59 ), and (3) pericytes (i.e., wound healing and scar formation, and endothelial tubulogenesis, plus apical membrane and cytoskeletal polarization, which mediates the interaction between endothelial cells and pericytes 60 , 61 ). Furthermore, looking at the host of inflammatory pathways changing (interferon, TNFα, complement, interleukin), primarily pro-inflammatory given the timeframe of this mission as well as environmental insults (e.g., radiation exposure, weightlessness) that also exacerbate the biochemical pathways that are being shifted after spaceflight (e.g., metabolic, cell phenotypic, increased apoptosis, etc.). Nonetheless, these first structural and molecular views into the epidermal response to spaceflight highlight key KRAS, immune, and related pathways that can be integrated in the future missions and on-site monitoring of crews 84 to help researchers understand the long-term effects of the spaceflight stressors and cellular changes we identified in this study."
Longitudinal multi-omics analysis of host microbiome architecture and immune responses during short-term spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11222149/,"Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals.

However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example, Fusobacteriota ), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. In total, this study reveals in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts experienced by astronauts during short-term spaceflight and the associated changes to the living environment, which can help guide future missions, spacecraft design and space habitat planning.","Moreover, crews have been documented as experiencing immune and viral reactivation 15 ; typically, this effect is not attributed solely to cohabitation, and we showed here that species potentially acquired from the environment in flight were not associated with immune cell changes—a topic that has been debated in previous studies 25 . Despite having more samples than all other astronaut microbiome studies combined, this effort still hosts a relatively small crew size ( n = 4), and we cannot determine from these data alone if an outside effect on the immune system is altering their abundance or expression or if microbiome ecology may be driving these and similar changes. Specifically, (1) we implemented multiple algorithms and compared their concordance, (2) set coverage thresholds for bacterial and viral taxa to filter probable false positives, (3) used multiple, state-of-the-art taxonomic classifiers and compared our findings among all of them, (4) mapped reads across five databases and (5) implemented and compared both generalized linear models and mixed effect models, bearing in mind that the latter can face interpretability challenges with smaller sample sizes."
Spatiotemporal expression and control of haemoglobin in space,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166948/,"Abstract It is now widely recognised that the environment in space activates a diverse set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways.

In this study, we examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research.","Gene expression analysis for the alpha and beta-globin loci At the alpha globin coding locus, a strong trend of down-regulation during flight was noted for the JAXA astronauts for the HBA1 and HBA2 genes (for the duration of readings from 5 days after launch to 60 days after launch), followed by an observed up-regulation in expression immediately upon return to ground, even higher than expression recorded pre-flight. This up-regulation upon return also plays a role in the response to an overall loss of red blood cell count, a well-documented occurrence in astronauts (referred to as space anaemia) which manifests itself as a mild form of anaemia, as showcased by a slight lowering of red blood cell count across several different astronauts in Fig. It has also been shown that mutations in the beta-globin CACC box prevent KLF1 binding, causing β -thalassaemia 6 KLF1 is indeed also known to be involved in the expression of beta-globin 25 , and the fact that the expression of KLF1 in-flight is somewhat reduced from the base expression observed pre-flight indicates that the production of adult beta-globins may be somewhat repressed, which would correlate with observations made in the expression of HBB, as aforementioned."
"Single-cell multi-ome and immune profiles of the Inspiration4 crew reveal conserved, cell-type, and sex-specific responses to spaceflight",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166952/,"To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a “spaceflight signature” of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health.","This study provides the most comprehensive immune profiling of astronauts to date, including single-cell multi-omics data, antibody isotypes, cfRNA abundance, BCR/TCR diversity, TFBS enrichments, sex-dependent changes, microbiome interactions, integration of other astronaut and mouse missions, and potential countermeasures. Nonetheless, the molecular measures from the I4 crew enabled new comparisons to prior missions (e.g., the NASA Twins Study, NASA JSC data, JAXA cfRNA) and meta-analysis of the space-flown mouse studies (817 samples across 27 datasets encompassing 10 different mouse tissues), which mostly confirmed our observations for the significantly altered pathways. In the coming years, NASA plans to put the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, and such ambitious missions can leverage the data shown here, which details cell-, person-, and sex-specific molecular data, thus guiding more precise risk mitigation, crew health monitoring, and long-term countermeasure development."
Single-cell analysis identifies conserved features of immune dysfunction in simulated microgravity and spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166937/,"Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways.","Specifically, the most consistently reproduced pathways impacted by simulated microgravity across immune cells in both single-cell and validation cohorts included changes to pathways and signaling linked to acute phase response signaling, Coronavirus pathogenesis, IL-6 signaling, the cytoskeleton, interferon response, pyroptosis, heat-shock, nuclear receptors, and sirtuin biology. We also observed changes in some active Rho GTPases by G-LISA, as well as in F-actin granularity, variance, 3D surface area, sphericity, actin protrusion length, and dynamic change to TLR stimulation by super-resolution microscopy, providing further evidence for changes in actin, including possibly immune cytoskeleton alteration or dysfunction, in simulated microgravity. Increased heat-shock coupled with reduced cold shock genes raises the possibility of higher intracellular temperatures directly induced by microgravity, but whether microgravity, or associated increase in cytokines or binding partners such as IL-1ra, directly induce the observed “space fever” in astronauts requires further insight 54 ."
The Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) and international astronaut biobank,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11357981/,"Abstract Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts and poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space 1 – 6 . Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study 7 , JAXA CFE study 8 , 9 , SpaceX Inspiration4 crew 10 – 12 , Axiom and Polaris. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.","In addition, although the same tube types and methods were used whenever possible, cross-mission comparisons will inevitably include noise from various other types of technical variation, including batches of library preparation and extraction kits, slightly different collection intervals (L−3 versus L−10) and different sequencing or profiling technologies (for example, Illumina versus Ultima or liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry versus NULISASeq). Finally, although the multi-omic data and resources from the I4 crew represent the largest release of data from astronauts to date, the I4 crew is still a small cohort, and represents only the first step towards resolving the many hazards and needs for long-term missions 32 , building towards enough statistical power and contextualization of normal human biological variation 33 , 34 . Fortunately, one of the crew members for I4 will continue to donate to the SOMA Biobank for multiple missions, including the Polaris Dawn mission, and data and samples from additional crews (for example, long-term Twins Study follow-up, Axiom Saudi, JAXA and Malta missions) are now being collected and integrated."
"Secretome profiling reveals acute changes in oxidative stress, brain homeostasis, and coagulation following short-duration spaceflight",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166969/,"By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development.","Although this study focuses on a short-term mission, our findings recapitulate several of the responses observed in the NASA Twins study including anemia, coagulation, and oxidative stress, as well as spaceflight-associated brain homeostasis alterations 15 , 22 , which indicate recurrent biological perturbations relevant for future crews and missions. Previous reports of space flown mice on brain state have shown decreased brain derived neurotrophic factor, induced neuron atrophy in the cerebral cortex, and overall oxidative stress, regulated partially through c-Jun/c-Fos 90 . Nonetheless, as human spaceflight becomes more prevalent, the necessity for deep secretome profiling can help establish baseline profiles for safer human space travel increases, and these tools can be part of the armamentarium of biomedical tools to help keep crews safe for upcoming, exploration-class missions, as well as continued health on Earth."
Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,"Abstract Future multi-year crewed planetary missions will motivate advances in aerospace nutrition and telehealth. Here, we propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research. As humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, high-resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceflight healthcare. Alongside the scientific potential, we consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the human space omics discipline, and how philosophical frameworks may benefit from international perspectives.","It seems probable that as increasingly large and diverse populations enter space, the purposeful implementation of routine standardized omics with consenting participants during spaceflight could similarly permit precision space healthcare and a Human Cell Space Atlas. While human space omics could catalyze critical improvement of safety measures for future space travelers, numerous ethical, cultural, and legal challenges would need to be carefully surmounted from global viewpoints. This manuscript provided examples of both the potential healthcare benefits and the ethical complexities that will likely be inherent to the human space omics discipline as a means to encourage anticipatory discussions amongst international ethicists, philosophers, scientists, and the public community."
Transcriptomics analysis reveals molecular alterations underpinning spaceflight dermatology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166967/,"Abstract Background Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. Methods To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4. Results Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression.","Here, we analyzed data from the skin of space flown mice and astronauts to try and identify possible explanations for these skin problems. It appears that changes in the activation of genes related to damage to DNA, skin barrier health, and mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of cells) may play a role in these skin problems. Further research will be needed to confirm exactly how these changes influence skin health, which could lead to solutions for preventing and managing such issues in astronauts."
"Cosmic kidney disease: an integrated pan-omic, physiological and morphological study into spaceflight-induced renal dysfunction",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167060/,"Yet the health consequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceflight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts’ increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR. Subject terms: Nephrons, Renal calculi, Thrombotic microangiopathies, Sequencing, Mass spectrometry","Further, thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium excretion 53 (possibly by ECV contraction causing increased proximal tubular calcium reabsorption 54 ) and reduce age related bone mineral density loss 55 , and could represent a “two birds with one stone” therapeutic option. Long-term, this can cause barotrauma or oxidative stress to renal microvasculature due to suboptimal perfusion, especially as the myogenic response of the afferent arteriole is to vasoconstrict and provide resistance (and thus reduce flow) in the face of excessive pulsatile pressure 62 . Therefore, in the absence of experiments that can more accurately model the long-term simultaneous exposure to full GCR and microgravity over several years, and the plausible synergistic impact of these insults, our results should be taken a conservative glimpse into the potential dire health consequences of long-term deep space travel."
Spaceflight induces changes in gene expression profiles linked to insulin and estrogen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166981/,"Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.","Given that insulin promotes protein synthesis, our finding of decreased expression in soleus of IRS2 (Insulin receptor substrate 2), one of major downstream insulin signaling, suggests that insulin alterations contribute to declines in protein synthesis to promote muscle atrophy in flight; this is also consistent with suggestions from spaceflown C. Overall, postflight up- and down-regulated genes associated with insulin signaling displayed enriched lipid metabolism, hormones (i.e., estrogen, growth hormone, glucagon), circadian rhythm, and immune system pathways. Particular attention should be paid to the effects on reproductive hormone synthesis and actions, as these impact a wide range of tissues, including bone health, energy metabolism and, of course species survival via reproduction."
Protective alleles and precision healthcare in crewed spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11263583/,"Abstract Common and rare alleles are now being annotated across millions of human genomes, and omics technologies are increasingly being used to develop health and treatment recommendations. However, these alleles have not yet been systematically characterized relative to aerospace medicine. Here, we review published alleles naturally found in human cohorts that have a likely protective effect, which is linked to decreased cancer risk and improved bone, muscular, and cardiovascular health. Although some technical and ethical challenges remain, research into these protective mechanisms could translate into improved nutrition, exercise, and health recommendations for crew members during deep space missions.","Indeed, ethical challenges include developing data accessibility and sharing strategies without violation of privacy of individuals and family members, achieving meaningful informed consent throughout the entire data lifecycle, avoiding uses of data that support actions of a discriminatory or inequitable nature, ensuring thorough and expert ethical oversight of projects, and appropriately handling any incidental findings from the data 134 , as well as issues regarding the challenge of protecting astronauts 135 , 136 . In this paper, we reviewed an example set of published alleles purportedly linked to protective effects, the biochemical pathways of which could inform therapeutic compound discovery and nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle recommendations to protect health during spaceflight missions and potentially during postflight recovery and stationing on planetary surfaces, including the Moon and Mars 138 . If humanity safely and effectively surmounts these hurdles, the revamped aerospace health recommendations that ensue could be incorporated with other types of countermeasures (such as artificial gravity, faster spacecraft, radiation shielding, and biotechnology for food and material production) in order to best preserve the well-being of life during future deep space missions and interplanetary exploration."

Growth chambers on the International Space Station for large plants,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10780891/,"Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the “space production” of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels).","Providing for people during long space expeditions, when working on remote objects of deep and near space, poses significant challenges for agronomic support and necessarily encourage the creation of water reclamation systems, efficient use of nutrients, and a closed cycle of plant cultivation with mandatory reproduction of plant crops from seed to seed [ 6 , 19 ]. Also, the hypothesis regarding the distortion of the shape of the kernel (Hypotheses B and C) were not confirmed, although early studies mentioned various types of deviations, for example, chromosome breakage [ 21 ], inability to produce seeds [ 22 , 23 ], distorted and non-viable embryos [ 24 ], and morphological abnormalities [ 25 ]. The baking properties of wheat are closely related to the composition (two types of glucose polymer, amylose, and amylopectin), structure, and morphology of starch granules, as well as storage proteins (gliadins and glutenins) of the grain, which determine the viscoelastic properties of the dough [ 31 , 32 ]."
Microbiological and nutritional analysis of lettuce crops grown on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7067979/,"To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log 10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.","Studies show that leafy greens grown in the field or greenhouse have a range of approximately 4–8 log 10 CFU bacterial counts per gram of sample while yeast and mold counts on lettuce are reported in the range of 2–5 log 10 ( Valentin-Bon and Jacobson, 2008 ; Rastogi et al., 2012 ; Jackson et al., 2013 ; Holvoet et al., 2015 ; Wood et al., 2015 ; Hagenmair and Baker, 2016 ; Oyinlola et al., 2017 ; Fröhling et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2018 ). Considering the chronological order of the experiments onboard the ISS, VEG-01B was grown a year later than VEG-01A, which raises the possibility of a change in the ISS water, but that may not be the only variable as plants grown in microgravity experience stresses from environmental conditions, so it would be impractical to draw any conclusions from these differences. By the final harvest photos indicated that some of the plants seemed to be transitioning to a reproductive growth phase, so it is possible that stresses from space flight may have pushed the plants to initiate senescence and that could provide a possible explanation for slightly lower elemental levels of some elements in VEG-03A samples ( Maillard et al., 2015 )."
Natural variation in the expression of ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 affects root length responses to cadaverine in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4321547/,"Highlight How the polyamine cadaverine alters plant development is poorly understood. Here it is shown that natural variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 affects root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine. Key words: Arabidopsis , cadaverine, natural variation, polyamines, roots, transporter.","Unfortunately, the levels of endogenous cadaverine in Arabidopsis seedling roots and shoots were below the level of detection using HPLC methods, preventing a distinction from being made between these possibilities. In animals, OCT proteins take up a wide variety of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, and, therefore, they affect substrate absorption, distribution, and excretion in many tissues.

Auxin: Shape matters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710492/,"Abstract We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on the structure of both micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which included prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based approach and a single 7-day exposure. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation.","The present investigation provides new evidence on the mode of action of the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax 50® in freshwater, which is one of the most frequently used commercial formulations in agricultural fields of Argentina. The observed variations in the essential constituents of microbial food chains can produce major functional changes, which are mainly concerned with carbon fluxes affecting the whole dynamics of a freshwater ecosystem. Despite the limitations of the experimental system, our results highlight the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict the sense, magnitude and direction of changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to 2,4-D formulations."
Gravity signaling in flowering plant roots,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12008199/,"Abstract Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 ( CRW1 ) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil.","Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1 , we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion 30 , we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1 , leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism."
Cadaverine regulates biotin synthesis to modulate primary root growth in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8518694/,"Here we conducted a forward genetic screen and isolated a mutation, cadaverine hypersensitive 3 ( cdh3 ), which resulted in increased root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine, but not other polyamines.

Furthermore, cadaverine‐treated seedlings displayed reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 of the acetyl‐coenzyme A carboxylase complex involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in decreased accumulation of triacylglycerides.

Low-speed clinorotation of Brachypodium distachyon and Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings triggers root tip curvatures that are reminiscent of gravitropism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9861679/,"Abstract Clinostats are instruments that continuously rotate biological specimens along an axis, thereby averaging their orientation relative to gravity over time. Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception ( pgm ) or gravity signal transduction ( arg1 , toc132 ) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association studies to further investigate this process.","When plates are positioned parallel to the clinostat axis, with Brachypodium seedlings oriented upright at the beginning of clinorotation (parallel clinorotation, Supplemental Figure S2E,F ), forward clinorotation at 0.2 RPM results in directing the air-facing side of the seedlings to the gravity vector during the first half-turn, ultimately leading to the roots lifting off the agar surface. Importantly, previous studies of amyloplast sedimentation in the root cap statocytes of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under the same growth conditions as our study have demonstrated significant sedimentation after only 1 or 2 min of reorientation [ 8 ], which is compatible with the time needed for the clinostat to complete its first half-turn under the inductive conditions used in this project. Considering that root gravitropism typically involves the creation of a lateral auxin gradient across the root cap, followed by its propagation toward the elongation zone where it promotes differential cellular elongation and tip curvature, we used a transgenic DII-VENUS auxin reporter to document the formation of a lateral auxin gradient across clinorotated seedlings, showing signal disappearance on the flank of the root that was directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of rotation."
New device for high-throughput viability screening of flow biofilms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897429/,"Abstract Control of biofilms requires rapid methods to identify compounds effective against them and to isolate resistance-compromised mutants for identifying genes involved in enhanced biofilm resistance. We describe here a new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of biofilm viability.","Thus, the BioFlux device used in conjunction with the GFP-PI viability assessment method is an excellent method for initial HTP screening of flow biofilms; this was verified by successful use of this method for HTP screening of PAO1 biofilms for sensitivity to a number of antimicrobials. The plate reader-based BioFlux viability screening method relied on the use of bacterial strains expressing GFP; for non-GFP-expressing bacteria another method, such as LIVE/DEAD Bac Light staining, must be used. For example, the LIVE/DEAD stain is accurate for determination of viability where the level of killing is high, which is often the goal of HTP screening; another possibility is to use a fluorogenic substrate, such as 4-methylumbellyferyl-β- d -glucuronide ( 28 ), to measure biofilm metabolic activity."
Sigma S-dependent antioxidant defense protects stationary-phase Escherichia coli against the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187989/,"Loss of σ s rendered stationary-phase Escherichia coli more sensitive to the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a weakened antioxidant defense. Use of the p sfiA genetic reporter, 3′-( p -hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) dye, and Amplex Red showed that Gm generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant. Greater oxidative stress, due to insufficient quenching of endogenous ROS and/or respiration-linked electron leakage, therefore contributed to the greater sensitivity of the mutant; infection by a uropathogenic strain in mice showed this to be the case also in vivo . Disruption of antioxidant defense by eliminating the quencher proteins, SodA/SodB and KatE/SodA, or the pentose phosphate pathway proteins, Zwf/Gnd and TalA, which provide NADPH for ROS decomposition, also generated greater oxidative stress and killing by Gm. Thus, besides its established mode of action, Gm also kills stationary-phase bacteria by generating oxidative stress, and targeting the antioxidant defense of E.","Three different methods of analysis were used: activation of the SOS response, which is a hallmark of the oxidative stress ( 48 ) that we monitored by a genetic reporter assay involving p sfiA ; the use of cell-penetrating dye HPF, which measures HO· ( 49 , 50 ); and the use of Amplex Red, which responds to H 2 O 2 ( 29 , 40 ). That the increased oxidative stress in the Δ rpoS mutant contributed to increased Gm lethality of this strain is shown by the fact that the drug toxicity was significantly mitigated when Gm treatment accompanied the administration of the antioxidant NAC or when cells were exposed to Gm under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. coli (AMG1) ( 34 , 35 ) in a mouse urinary tract infection (UTI) model showed that this is the case also in vivo : Gm at a low concentration compromised the ability of the UPEC rpoS mutant to colonize female mouse bladder but not when the antioxidant NAC was also administered ( Fig."
Plasma membrane disruption (PMD) formation and repair in mechanosensitive tissues,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217198/,"One such mechanism is the formation of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD), which foster a molecular flux across cell membranes that promotes tissue adaptation. PMD have been observed to influence the mechanical behavior of skin, alveolar, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, neurons, and most recently, bone cells including osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and osteocytes. PMD are therefore positioned to affect the physiological behavior of a wide range of vertebrate organ systems including skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, the respiratory system, and the skeleton. The purpose of this review is to describe the processes of PMD formation and repair across these mechanosensitive tissues, with a particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting repair mechanisms and downstream signaling to better understand the role of PMD in skeletal mechanobiology.","In conclusion, this review has highlighted that PMD are a key mechanosensation mechanism in the processes by which mechanosensitive mammalian cells detect and respond to mechanical loading in their environment. While bone may be the most recently discovered tissue to develop and respond to PMD with loading, it is notable that all responses downstream of PMD in bone cells discovered thus far are consistent with PMD responses reported in other mechanosensitive tissues like epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and myocytes. Thus, PMD formation and repair may represent a novel mechanosensation pathway in bone and a target for modifying skeletal adaptation signaling in osteocytes, such as strategies aimed at improving bone mechanosensitivity with aging."

Response of the mouse sublingual gland to spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6131065/,Abstract The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground control and flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared to ground control mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Determining changes in salivary proteins may lead to development of non-invasive methods to assess the physiological status of astronauts.,"The parotid glands of the same mice on both flights showed an increase in autophagic vacuoles in the serous acinar cells, an increased incidence of apoptotic acinar cells, and the presence of large endocytic vacuoles containing acinar secretory proteins in intercalated and striated duct cells ( 12 , 13 ). Human genome sequence analysis has revealed that the human homologue of rodent PSP, a member of the PLUNC (palate, lung, nasal clone) family of secretory proteins, is expressed in human parotid as well as submandibular glands ( 32 ). Gravitational changes, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise and circadian and sleep disturbances are some of the parameters contributing to astronauts’ physical and psychological stress level and resulting in hormonal changes ( 5 )."
Effects of spaceflight on the mouse submandibular gland,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11233762/,"Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 ( Vamp8 ) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity.","Our study showed no increase in the expression of mRNA related to receptors for noradrenaline secreted from sympathetic nerves involved in protein secretion, where is the upstream of salivary secretion system, while upregulations of Rap/Rab signaling for transporting intracellular vesicles and v-SNARE (Vamp8) to secrete amylase via exocytosis at apical side of acinar cells were observed in the 1/6 g environment. Overall, our data suggested that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via vesicular transport and exocytosis mediated by Rap/Rab signaling and Vamp8 at apical side of acinar cells ( Figure 11 ). Further research on salivary secretion signal and gene regulation may contribute to the future monitoring of the physical and mental health of humans living in space as well as the improvement of oral medicine."
"Reactivation of Latent Epstein-Barr Virus: A Comparison after Exposure to Gamma, Proton, Carbon, and Iron Radiation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213004/,"Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 137 Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription.","At this point it is not possible to formally identify the cause of the differences in viral reactivation resulting from proton and gamma irradiation because many factors may be involved, like damage to DNA and/or other biomolecules such as proteins and enzymes, which may be dependent on the type of radiation. In this in vitro experiment the immune system was not present thereby providing strong evidence that radiation of latently infected cells alone is likely a major contributor to the reactivation of herpes viruses observed in astronauts. In conclusion, four types of radiation ( 137 Cs gamma rays, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions) induced EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This was observed in the absence of any cytokine production or involvement of the immune system."
The influence of spaceflight on the astronaut salivary microbiome and the search for a microbiome biomarker for viral reactivation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171750/,"Abstract Background Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Conclusions This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.","It is unknown how increased bacterial richness may promote EBV reactivation and/or replication, but one possibility is that certain strains, that may be beneficial in maintaining latency and/or curbing viral growth, become diluted in the sample (i.e., relative abundance decreases) and thus do not have as profound an impact on the host. Another hypothesis could be that the additional strains not present in virus negative samples produce metabolites that (i) induce reactivation, (ii) directly interact with the viral particle to increase propagation, and/or (iii) minimize the ability of the host to properly clear viral particles. In addition to its aforementioned inverse correlation with viral load and its predictive potential in random forests, Haemophilus , like Veillonella , had a higher relative abundance in samples that came from subjects that never had a reactivation episode compared to samples that were negative for virus but that came from subjects that had a reactivation episode at least once (Figure S 4 B)."
The cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNGC14 regulates root gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10414970/,"Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H + -ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H + -ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel.","We showed that apart from pH, FS can also react to other ions, however, given that the surface pH profile visualized by FS staining is in full accordance with the previously published works ( Weisenseel and Meyer, 1997 ; Weisenseel et al., 1979 ; Björkman and Leopold, 1987 ; Behrens et al., 1982 ; Iwabuchi et al., 1989 ; Staal et al., 2011 ), we conclude that in the growth media, FS reflects primarily the root surface pH. Upon gravistimulation, the alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified, which is consistent with previous pH measurements done by electrodes ( Zieschang et al., 1993 ; Monshausen et al., 1996 ), indicating that the alkaline domain corresponds to a zone of a stalled cell elongation that can be rapidly regulated upon gravistimulation. In addition to the gene expression changes that occur during obstacle avoidance ( Jacobsen et al., 2021 ) and the FERONIA-mediated mechanoperception ( Shih et al., 2014 ), the rapid auxin response module in the root decreases the reaction time of the root to the changes of root growth direction, and thus increases the efficiency of root soil penetration."

Persistent NF-Œ∫B activation in muscle stem cells induces proliferation-independent telomere shortening,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8183356/,"SUMMARY During the repeated cycles of damage and repair in many muscle disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the muscle stem cell (MuSC) pool becomes less efficient at responding to and repairing damage.

We find that prolonged NF-κB activation in MuSCs in chronic injuries leads to shortened telomeres and Ku80 dysregulation and results in severe skeletal muscle defects. Our studies provide evidence of a role for NF-κB in regulating stem-cell-specific telomere length, independently of cell replication, and could be a congruent mechanism that is applicable to additional tissues and/or diseases characterized by systemic chronic inflammation.","During the repeated cycles of damage and repair in many muscle disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the muscle stem cell (MuSC) pool becomes less efficient at responding to and repairing damage.

These findings advance our fundamental understanding of how stem cells respond to injury and identify Piezo1 as a key regulator for adjusting stem cell states essential for regeneration.","Future investigation of additional intrinsic and extrinsic regulators or other sensors that could be responsible for preserving MuSC protrusions, in combination with extracellular matrices that mimic the living architectural muscle cues ( 59 ) and retain cell-matrix interactions, including nerve injuries that were recently shown to affect MuSC morphology ( 60 ), would allow direct assessment of the essential communication between MuSC states, the niche, and the surrounding environment, including the neuromuscular and myotendinous junctions. These data further suggest that in the absence of Piezo1, MuSCs lengthen their protrusions to better perceive their injured immediate microenvironment and reduce their proliferation rate at the cost of delaying muscle regeneration, in agreement with previous reports ( 64 , 65 ) and consistent with the idea that inactivation of proper cell channels impedes a transition from a resting state to an activated state ( 3 , 25 , 27 ). To test this assertion, we next asked whether temporary pharmacological activation of Piezo1 was sufficient to reverse the defective morphology of dystrophic MuSCs. Our data revealed that administration of Yoda1 restores MuSC state distribution, shortens protrusion length, and alters stem cell shape to more closely resemble a healthy MuSC, while muscle regeneration is boosted."
"Impacts of radiation exposure, hindlimb unloading, and recovery on murine skeletal muscle cell telomere length.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10504369/,"Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth.","ALT was originally discovered in immortalized cell lines and subsequently shown to occur in some human tumors 64 , 65 While evidence is mounting that ALT can be regulated by environmental and genetic factors in rapidly proliferating tumor cells 44 , its modulation and engagement in quiescent non-cancerous cells has not been explored, particularly while maintaining tissue structure. In conclusion, the data presented here lay a foundation for future studies to explore telomere length regulation in skeletal muscles during spaceflight conditions, to investigate whether ALT drivers exert cell type-specific influences on telomere length, and how long these changes last and how they contribute to health risks in astronauts after they return to Earth. Identifying the cellular and molecular muscle changes associated with telomere lengthening, as well as how ALT-related processes affect spaceflight-exposed cells, may yield important clues for future prophylactic therapy of astronauts’ muscles, both during space flights and upon return to Earth."
Ethylene-induced flavonol accumulation in guard cells suppresses reactive oxygen species and modulates stomatal aperture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3982735/,"In the epidermis of Arabidopsis leaves, flavonols specifically accumulate in
guard cells with enhanced synthesis in the presence of ethylene, where they lower
the levels of reactive oxygen species and reduce the rate of stomatal
closure .","Combined with our data suggesting an in planta antioxidant ability of flavonols, we hypothesize that flavonol accumulation in the nuclei may modulate the activity of redox-sensitive TF s that affect gene expression in addition to preventing oxidative damage to DNA, although the time scale of transcriptional effects may be beyond the rapid regulation of guard cell aperture. In our study, a previously reported ROS burst that was observed upon ethylene treatment of wild-type guard cells ( Desikan et al., 2006 ) was masked by increased flavonol accumulation, but we observed that a 24-h ethylene treatment of tt4 led to elevated ROS (although this increase was not detected after 3 h of treatment), consistent with the absence of antioxidants. Other researchers report that treatment of wild-type plants with ethylene or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid or endogenous ethylene overproduction in eto1 inhibit stomatal closure in the presence of ABA in Arabidopsis ( Tanaka et al., 2005 ) and in wheat ( Triticum durum ; Chen et al., 2013 )."
Transcriptional and Hormonal Regulation of Gravitropism of Woody Stems in Populus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682325/,"Fundamental mechanisms associated with gravitropism in woody stems of Populus involve relocalization of the PIN3 auxin transporter and interacting roles for auxin, gibberellic acid, and the ARBORKNOX2 transcription factor in regulating fiber development and gravibending.","In this study, we identified key regulatory mechanisms involved in negative gravitropic responses in woody Populus stems, including the cells responsible for graviperception, the initial graviresponse via relocalization of the PIN3 auxin transporter, and interacting roles for auxin, GA , and the ARK2 transcription factor in regulating fiber development and gravibending. This lateral auxin transport and response represents the earliest known graviresponse of woody stems and provides an obvious initial mechanism triggering the different developmental fates of xylem tissues that develop on the top (tension wood) versus bottom (opposite wood) of the gravistimulated stem. These results would be consistent with the idea that decreased levels of ARK2 transcript are associated with elevated GA levels, similar to previous work in herbaceous species that have demonstrated a direct positive regulation of GA catabolism-related and negative regulation of GA biosynthesis-related genes by Class I KNOX transcription factors ( Sakamoto et al., 2001 ; Jasinski et al., 2005 ; Bolduc and Hake, 2009 )."
Endosidin2 targets conserved exocyst complex subunit EXO70 to inhibit exocytosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10264680/,"Abstract To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake.","Some other important plasma membrane proteins, such as Rho family small GTPases (ROPs), multidrug resistance-like ABC transporter family proteins, and aquaporin plasma membrane intrinsic proteins were not affected by ES2 treatment in this proteomics study ( Supplementary Table S1 ), which is consistent with the previous live-cell imaging results ( Zhang et al., 2016 ). The composition of plasma membrane proteins changes upon salt stress, cold treatment, osmotic stress, immune signaling, nutrient deficiency and different growth stages of cultured cells ( Nohzadeh Malakshah et al., 2007 ; Nouri and Komatsu, 2010 ; Elmore et al., 2012 ; Li et al., 2012 ; Cao et al., 2016 ; Chen et al., 2016 ; Li et al., 2018 ). Previous findings on the essential functions of plant exocyst complex in plant growth and immune responses ( Synek et al., 2006 ; Fendrych et al., 2010 ; Kulich et al., 2010 ; Kulich et al., 2015 ; Cole et al., 2018 ; Du et al., 2018 ; Guo et al., 2018 ; Žárský, 2022 ) support the hypothesis that the exocyst complex choreographs the dynamic change of specific proteins at the plasma membrane in response to different environmental stimuli and growth cues."
"A conditional mutation in SCD1 reveals linkage between PIN protein trafficking, auxin transport, gravitropism, and lateral root initiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358545/,"Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature.","Auxin-induced gene expression, visualized via DR5-GFP fluorescence ( Muday and Rahman, 2008 ; Geisler et al., 2014 ) was rapidly enhanced on the lower side of Col(g) roots after gravitropic reorientation, but was impaired in scd1-1 seedlings relative to wild type only in plants grown at 25°C. As all of these proteins are trafficked and recycled, and the scd1-1 mutation most strongly affects PIN1 and PIN2 and dependent physiological processes, there appears to be selectivity of SCD1 targets toward PIN2 and PIN1, which is consistent with other studies that reveal distinct regulatory and trafficking machinery between auxin transporters ( Barbosa and Schwechheimer, 2014 ; Weller et al., 2017 ). The localization of PIN2-GFP in late endosomal compartments in scd1-1 is consistent with reports that PIN protein turnover involves both cycling between the endosome and plasma membrane and vacuolar degradation, depending on environmental conditions ( Paciorek et al., 2005 ; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008b ; Grunewald and Friml, 2010 ; Jasik et al., 2013 )."
"A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, Part 1: Intracellular overdrive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9108708/,"Abstract COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has claimed approximately 5 million lives and 257 million cases reported globally. This virus and disease have significantly affected people worldwide, whether directly and/or indirectly, with a virulent pathogen that continues to evolve as we race to learn how to prevent, control, or cure COVID-19. The focus of this review is on the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ mechanism of infection and its proclivity at adapting and restructuring the intracellular environment to support viral replication. We highlight current knowledge and how scientific communities with expertize in viral, cellular, and clinical biology have contributed to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, and how these findings may help explain the widely varied clinical observations of COVID-19 patients.","We detail research on early infection using evidence from patient samples, organoids and cells, and non-human animal studies. Key avenues of future research on SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation include: 1) defining the mechanisms of how the virus enters cells, and the protein and receptor molecules that are critical to this process; 2) elucidating the dynamics of how protein machinery is captured and retrofitted for viral purposes in a cell-specific manner; 3) understanding how the host genetics and environment can affect the ability of the virus to infect; 4) understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation; and 5) revealing how the mitochondria adapts to ultimately shift its physiology from steady-state. In the best-case scenario for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, infection leads to a cascade of intracellular adaptations in which multiple networks are remodeled, from transcription to metabolism to signal transduction, shifting the invaded host cell from its original physiology into a SARS-CoV-2 replication system, and causing the emission of new viral particles and signaling molecules."
Changes in nuclear shape and gene expression in response to simulated microgravity are LINC complex-dependent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555797/,"Abstract Microgravity is known to affect the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell and nuclear morphology and to elicit differential expression of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions and the extracellular matrix. Although the nucleus is mechanically connected to the cytoskeleton through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the role of this group of proteins in these responses to microgravity has yet to be defined. In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of exposure to simulated microgravity.","Thus, understanding how SMG affects these cellular processes holds potential for both understanding how gravitational forces might be playing roles in normal tissue development on Earth and in revealing potential practical issues and risks related to long duration spaceflight. As discussed earlier, the cytoskeleton reorganizes in microgravity, with disruption of the microtubule network, and a so-called ‘loosening’ of the cytokeratin network around the nucleus, and this may be the reason for the rounding up of the nucleus (increased nuclear height and decrease in x-y area) in GFP-KDEL control cells exposed to 2 h of SMG. Taken together, our results imply that the mechanical forces on a cell imposed through altered gravity are likely acting through LINC complex-related transduction events to modulate both nuclear shape and patterns of gene expression, especially of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and other mechanical features of the cell."

In addition, the martian regolith itself contains numerous potentially biotoxic factors, such as salinity, pH, and Eh of available liquid water; oxidizing soils created by UV-induced processes and soil chemical reactions; or the presence of heavy metals (discussed extensively in refs.

"Exposure of Bacillus subtilis to low pressure (5 kilopascals) induces several global regulons, including those involved in the SigB-mediated general stress response",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4135744/,"In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, belonged to the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon.","subtilis to LP most notably induced the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) ( 44 ); transition-state regulons such as AbrB/Abh ( 45 , 46 ), CodY ( 47 ), Rok ( 48 ), SigH ( 49 ), Spo0A ( 50 ), and, to a lesser extent, SigD ( 51 ); anaerobic regulons, such as ResD ( 52 ) and, to a lesser extent, Fnr ( 53 ) and Rex ( 54 ); the carbon catabolite repression regulator CcpA ( 55 ); and the IolR regulator of myo -inositol catabolism ( 56 ). In this study, we found by microarray experiments that Bacillus subtilis strain WN624 sensed and responded to LP stress by activation of at least a dozen known regulons, including the SigB-mediated GSR, and this notion was confirmed by the SigB-dependent induction of ctc-lacZ fusion expression by exposure of cells to LP. One consequence of lowering the headspace pressure from ∼101 to 5 kPa is to lower the partial pressure of oxygen in the medium by a factor of roughly 20; this might immediately lead to induction of the anaerobic response involving the ResD, Fnr, and Rex regulons (see Tables S2 and S3 in the supplemental material)."
"Resistance of Bacillus subtilis Spore DNA to Lethal Ionizing Radiation Damage Relies Primarily on Spore Core Components and DNA Repair, with Minor Effects of Oxygen Radical Detoxification",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3911009/,"Abstract The roles of various core components, including α/β/γ-type small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP), dipicolinic acid (DPA), core water content, and DNA repair by apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in Bacillus subtilis spore resistance to different types of ionizing radiation including X rays, protons, and high-energy charged iron ions have been studied. Spores deficient in DNA repair by NHEJ or AP endonucleases, the oxidative stress response, or protection by major α/β-type SASP, DPA, and decreased core water content were significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than wild-type spores, with highest sensitivity to high-energy-charged iron ions. DNA repair via NHEJ and AP endonucleases appears to be the most important mechanism for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, whereas oxygen radical detoxification via the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response or KatX catalase activity plays only a very minor role. Synergistic radioprotective effects of α/β-type but not γ-type SASP were also identified, indicating that α/β-type SASP's binding to spore DNA is important in preventing DNA damage due to reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation.","DNA strand breaks were reported to be the major lesions in the genome of spores exposed to ionizing radiation (reviewed in references 4 and 7 ), caused either directly by the highly energetic photons or accelerated particles or indirectly via interaction of radiation-induced free radicals, e.g., ROS, with the DNA ( 9 , 13 , 15 , 16 ). As a consequence, DNA properties in spores are dramatically different from those in vegetative cells, e.g., spore DNA complexed with SASP is much more resistant to chemical attack, thermal degradation, and UV radiation ( 6 , 7 , 17 , 22 , 40 ), strongly suggesting that SASP may also be important for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, as indicated in earlier studies testing mutants lacking a single SASP ( 17 , 33 ). The findings in this communication thus complement the results from microarray experiments demonstrating upregulation of stress-related regulons responding to DNA damage (SOS response) and oxidative stress (PerR regulon) during germination of spores exposed to space conditions, including the effects of galactic cosmic radiation ( 41 )."
Cultivation of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the human spaceflight environment leads to alterations in the frequency and spectrum of spontaneous rifampicin-resistance mutations in the rpoB gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4923109/,The effect of the human spaceflight environment on the growth and the frequency of mutations to antibiotic resistance in the model organism Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC12228 was investigated. Six cultures of the test organism were cultivated in biological research in canisters–Petri dish fixation units for 122 h on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the SpaceX-3 resupply mission. Asynchronous ground controls (GCs) consisted of identical sets of cultures cultivated for 122 h in the ISS Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center. epidermidis isolates cultivated in the ISS compared to GCs. The results suggest that the human spaceflight environment induces unique physiologic stresses on growing bacterial cells leading to changes in mutagenic potential.,"The observations that (i) astronaut immune function becomes dysregulated during long-term spaceflight ( Guéguinou et al., 2009 ; Crucian et al., 2014 ; Taylor, 2015 ); (ii) certain opportunistic bacteria can upregulate virulence functions in spaceflight ( Rosenzweig et al., 2014 ; Taylor, 2015 ); and (iii) spaceflight can alter the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria ( Lapchine et al., 1986 ; Tixador et al., 1994 ) have underscored the importance of studying the causes and consequences of the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the human spaceflight environment. Microgravity affects a bacterial culture in a number of ways, for example: (i) buoyancy or sedimentation of cells is effectively negated; (ii) the rate of heat and mass transfer via passive convection becomes negligible, and in fact transfer of heat, nutrients, and waste toxins in a static culture becomes dominated by the rate of diffusion; and (iii) liquid behavior at solid surfaces and air–water interfaces is altered in microgravity, as surface tension, viscosity, capillary action, and wetting are removed from gravitational influence ( Rosenzweig et al., 2014 ). We and others have previously shown that single point mutations in rpoB leading to Rif R can profoundly alter the global pattern of gene expression in bacteria and lead to (i) changes in growth, transformation, sporulation and spore resistance properties ( Maughan et al., 2004 ; Moeller et al., 2012 ); (ii) activation of otherwise cryptic phenotypes ( Perkins and Nicholson, 2008 ); and (iii) artificial triggering of the stringent response (reviewed in Alifano et al., 2015 )."

Cultivation in space flight produces minimal alterations in the susceptibility of Bacillus subtilis cells to 72 different antibiotics and growth-inhibiting compounds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5648920/,"To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space flight microgravity on the International Space Station, termed flight (FL) samples, or at Earth-normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. Only 9 compounds were identified by PM screening as exhibiting significant differences ( P < 0.05, Student's t test) in FL versus GC samples: 6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, manganese(II) chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and trifluoperazine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay did not reveal statistically significant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) between FL and GC samples. IMPORTANCE This study addresses a major concern of mission planners for human space flight, that bacteria accompanying astronauts on long-duration missions might develop a higher level of resistance to antibiotics due to exposure to the space flight environment.","In a separate experiment using the same biological research in canisters (BRIC)-21 FL and GC samples as those tested here, we measured the frequencies of mutations to antibiotic resistance in all of the FL and GC petri dish fixation units (PDFUs) used in this study (data to be published elsewhere). For example, the resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast to the antifungal agent voriconazole was shown to differ in FL versus GC samples using the free-flying PharmaSat nanosatellite ( 8 ); such a design could readily be adapted for high-throughput in-flight antibiotic screening either by a free-flying nanosatellite or by a small semiautonomous payload sent to the ISS. Many aspects of the interplay among the host, the microbe, and the antibiotic (such as modes of entry, routes of pathogenesis, pharmacokinetics, etc.), which have been studied extensively in Earth-bound clinical settings, have yet to be explored in the space flight environment."
Alterations in the Spectrum of Spontaneous Rifampicin-Resistance Mutations in the Bacillus subtilis rpoB Gene after Cultivation in the Human Spaceflight Environment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5817088/,"Abstract The effect of Bacillus subtilis exposure to the human spaceflight environment on growth, mutagenic frequency, and spectrum of mutations to rifampicin resistance (Rif R ) was investigated. subtilis cells were cultivated in Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) on two separate missions to the International Space Station (ISS), dubbed BRIC-18 and BRIC-21, with matching asynchronous ground controls.

The results strengthen the idea that exposure to the human spaceflight environment causes unique stresses on bacteria, leading to alterations in their mutagenic potential.","Some of these prior studies have shown increased final cell density during spaceflight, while others have found either no significant differences between spaceflight and 1 × g conditions (reviewed in Benoit and Klaus, 2007 ; Horneck et al., 2010 ; Kim et al., 2013 ; Rosenzweig et al., 2014 ; Coil et al., 2016 ), or even decreased growth in spaceflight ( Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016 ). matched ground control samples was directly measured in the SESLO (Space Environment Survivability of Living Organisms) payload of the O/OREOS nanosatellite, and in that experiment cells were observed to grow at a slower rate in spaceflight ( Nicholson et al., 2011 ). GC Samples Although the human spaceflight environment in Low Earth Orbit is characterized by an increased flux of high-energy particles, and enhanced space radiation effects have been documented in astronauts and higher organisms (reviewed in De Micco et al., 2011 ; Maalouf et al., 2011 ), very few studies to date have tested the notion that exposure to the human spaceflight environment could lead to increased mutagenesis in microbes."

It is thought that the LINC complex is intimately involved in modulation of genome expression in response to mechanical stimuli through chromatin remodeling and recruitment of DNA and RNA polymerases, ligases, acetylases, methylases, and cyclin-dependent kinases, resulting in changes in gene expression at the transcriptional, translational, post-translational, and epigenetic levels [ 19 , 20 ]. As was mentioned in a previous review [ 9 ], microbes possess both functional and structural analogs of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton; indeed, cytoskeletal components from all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) are phylogenetically related, indicating their descent from a common ancestor early in evolution [ 48 ]. Adhesins present on the cell surface are able to sense forces such as shear, compression, or tension and transduce these signals to the cell interior, activating the production of second messenger molecules such as cAMP and cyclic di-GMP which in turn activate or repress transcription of target genes [ 45 ]."
Environmental dependence of competitive fitness in rifampin-resistant rpoB mutants of Bacillus subtilis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8904044/,"In Bacillus subtilis , mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. Rif r rpoB mutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural environments typically inhabited by B. Using a novel deep-sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of specific rpoB alleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic.","We therefore conclude that while the second-site mutation I528V in rpoB increased competitive fitness to a certain extent, it was not sufficient to account for the dramatic increase in fitness seen in strain 1663 arising in the third multiallelic competition culture in the experiment whose results are shown in Fig. Several examples illustrate the repeated occurrence of rpoB mutations in adaptive laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli , wherein these mutations significantly increased the fitness of the organism in different environments, including optimized growth on various minimal media and increased fitness at elevated temperatures ( 30 – 32 ). Numerous studies suggest changes in global gene expression to be the cause of changes in fitness observed with mutations in rpoB ( 7 , 33 – 37 ), although one study examining the system-wide impacts of mutations in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa rpoB gene found few differences in global gene expression and attributed mutant phenotypes to increased expression of RNAP ( 38 )."
Analysis of interactions of Salmonella type three secretion mutants with 3-D intestinal epithelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3012082/,"Abstract The prevailing paradigm of Salmonella enteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo- like models. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predicting in vivo -like pathogenic mechanisms.","HT-29 cells grown in three-dimensions in the RWV displayed numerous characteristics relevant to their in vivo tissue counterparts, demonstrating the potential of utilizing RWV-derived 3-D cells as surrogate models to elucidate cellular mechanisms and responses to conditions encountered in the human gastrointestinal tract, such as during an enteric pathogen infection , . These studies not only corroborate our findings regarding the lack of Salmonella dependence on SPI-1 to invade our 3-D organotypic intestinal epithelial models, but also demonstrate the urgent need for development of more in vivo- like cell culture systems and their use in combination with animal models to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease. The work presented here reveals many key similarities between the response of in vitro 3-D models of human intestinal epithelium and their parental tissues in vivo during a Salmonella infection, highlighting the potential of these organotypic models to 1) serve as powerful tools to facilitate the dissection of the molecular mechanisms of human enteric salmonellosis, 2) provide an in vivo like system to study other gastrointestinal pathogens, and 3) serve as models for the development of novel strategies to combat infectious disease."

Induction of attachment-independent biofilm formation and repression of Hfq expression by low-fluid-shear culture of Staphylococcus aureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3187170/,"Abstract The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encounters a wide variety of fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or transitions to cause disease. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. aureus responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.","Within the large intestine exists a vast range of microenvironments attributable to luminal flow rates, variations in the mucus layer, interactions with epithelial surfaces, and continually changing levels of nutrients, which microorganisms must be able to withstand ( 40 ). aureus has long been considered a member of the intestinal flora ( 15 , 61 ) but has received little investigative attention as to its potential role as an infectious agent of gastroenteritis, as opposed to its known role as a cause of toxigenic gastroenteristis, wherein ingestion of preformed staphylococcal enterotoxins in contaminated food, and not the presence of the organism in the gut, is known to cause disease ( 17 ). Using microarray analysis, we were able to identify increased expression profiles correlating to 17 ORFs. Biochemically, the protein products of many of these genes can be connected to a fermentative metabolism, as formate acetyltransferase, d -lactate dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase were upregulated in response to low-fluid-shear culture."
Characterization of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ydcI gene which encodes a conserved DNA binding protein required for full acid stress resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3133089/,"Abstract Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses a stimulon of genes that are differentially regulated in response to conditions of low fluid shear force that increase bacterial virulence and alter other phenotypes. In this study, we show that a previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon, ydcI or STM1625, encodes a highly conserved DNA binding protein with related homologs present in a range of Gram-negative bacterial genera. Typhimurium Δ ydcI mutant was able to invade cultured cells to the same degree as the WT strain, but a strain in which ydcI expression is induced invaded cells at a level 2.8 times higher than that of the WT. These data indicate the ydcI gene encodes a conserved DNA binding protein involved with aspects of prokaryotic biology related to stress resistance and possibly virulence.","These results indicate that the ydcI gene likely serves as a DNA binding transcriptional regulator that regulates genes involved in aspects of bacterial biology, including stress resistance and possibly virulence. A major goal in the future study of ydcI will be to identify the genes that are members of a potential “YdcI regulon” to understand how genes regulated by YdcI are linked to stress resistance, host cell interactions, biofilm formation, and other prokaryotic functions. In addition, future studies will focus on determining if ydcI has a role in the transmission of the low fluid shear environmental cue to bacterial cells beyond the experiments performed here."

This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor.","Assessing the behavior and virulence potential of obligate and opportunistic pathogens aboard spacecraft and the International Space Station (ISS) is of central importance to evaluate the risk for infectious disease in the context of long-term manned missions. The observation that spaceflight samples were presumably more deprived of oxygen than LSMMG-grown bacteria, compared to their respective controls, could be explained by the fact that actual spaceflight conditions are characterized by even lower fluid shear levels than LSMMG conditions. Indeed, enhanced irradiation and vibration or potential direct effects of microgravity (such as effects on the cell or cellular components instead of on the extracellular environment) during spaceflight could lead to differences in gene and protein expression profiles between spaceflight and LSMMG-grown P."

Transfecting cells expressing FUT2 with NV RNA (isolated from virus from the stool samples of infected volunteers) did result in NV replication and synthesis of NV proteins within the cells, suggesting that the block in NV replication following virus addition to the cells occurs at a postbinding step and may require an additional cellular factor for viral entry and/or uncoating ( 5 , 32 , 38 , 39 ). Future attempts to develop in vitro systems to study NoV replication may include cultures derived from human primary intestinal cells and tissue explants, utilization of Caco-2 cells grown in RWV, use of 3-D intestinal immunocompetent coculture models, or human intestinal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells ( 40 , 41 )."

Effects of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space: Immune System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7467030/,"Abstract To address urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this review describes experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that suggests that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before infection might increase risk of COVID-19 mortality in multiple ways. Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na + /K + -ATPase, chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before exposure to COVID-19 may conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition.","In sum, this paper hypothesizes that sub-optimal hydration in the weeks prior to exposure to COVID-19 increases risk of COVID-19 mortality via multiple possible pathways that favor fluid accumulation in the lungs. Evidence from in-vitro, animal, clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that chronic plasma hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia may increase the likelihood of COVID-19 infection, pre-set the body for exaggerated immune response, increase tissue damage and leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or decrease capacity for active and passive transport of fluid out of the airway space. Taken together, the evidence suggests that strategies to limit COVID-19 mortality may need to account for multiple determinants of water retention, fluid entry into and fluid removal out of the lungs, simultaneously."
Recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds is enhanced by dynamic suspension culture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4427280/,"We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic suspension culture is promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix of the scaffolds with subsequent effects on differentiation and functionality of inoculated cells.","Cortiella et al previously demonstrated that decellularized lungs repopulated with ESCs in the RWV retained more viable cells and induced higher levels of apparent lung-specific lineages in response to defined differentiation agents, compared to other synthetic scaffolds and 2-D ESC monolayers [ 7 ]. In line with this hypothesis is (i) the induced expression of the multipotency markers endoglin and CD106 in static but not bioreactor conditions, and (ii) the absence of MSC cell clusters in bioreactor growth conditions, which could possibly be a characteristic of multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells that have the ability to differentiate into endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm in vitro and in vivo [ 51 , 52 ]. Since MSCs have been suggested to serve as stroma for repopulating decellularized scaffolds with other cell types (such as endogenous progenitors and induced pluripotent stem cells) [ 63 ], further investigations into whether the enhanced expression of genes involved in ECM remodeling in the RWV bioreactor resulted in reconstituting and/or remodeling of the native ECM scaffold is of interest."
Three-dimensional organotypic co-culture model of intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages to study Salmonella enterica colonization patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5460263/,"Abstract Three-dimensional models of human intestinal epithelium mimic the differentiated form and function of parental tissues often not exhibited by two-dimensional monolayers and respond to Salmonella in key ways that reflect in vivo infections.

HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical profiling and bead uptake assays.

Possible explanations for these infection patterns following culture of the bacteria under low oxygen conditions prior to infection include: (1) pathogen avoidance of macrophages, (2) specific targeting of epithelial cells, (3) enhanced intracellular killing within macrophages, and/or (4) a masking effect whereby the macrophages are unable to detect the pathogen, leading to lower levels of uptake."

To our knowledge, this was the first in-flight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells.",Further information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.
Rapid phenotypic response of LSMMG-'primed' Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11888247/,albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). albicans -colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE 2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE 2 receptors. albicans -colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE 2 signaling in these phenotypes.,"These results support the model that, as PGE 2 in the circulation elevates above normal fluctuating ranges, BBB permeability increases, and more PGE 2 can enter the brain, resulting in correlations between its concentration in serum and Ep1/Ep2 receptor expression in C. Interestingly, expression in the PFC and NAc did not indicate similar changes to the dopamine system, and other genes implicated in addiction such as neuropeptide Y receptors, opioid receptors (Mu and Delta), proopiomelanocortin ( Pomc ), and Fos were unchanged. albicans -colonized mice injected with ethanol showed increased LORR onset, decreased locomotion in the open field test (OFT), and further impaired performance on the balance beam."
Spaceflight enhances cell aggregation and random budding in Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3851762/,"Abstract This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans , grown in spaceflight conditions. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.","Thus, studying the responses of microbial cells to the microgravity environment of spaceflight holds potential for the discovery of novel infectious disease mechanisms that cannot be observed using conventional culture conditions, where the force of gravity can mask key cellular responses. It would seem unlikely that increased gene expression related to oxidative stress resistance is due to the presence of increased oxygen levels since previously reported gene expression profiles of bacterial FPA cultures exposed to spaceflight indicated responses to microaerophilic/anaerobic conditions, presumably due to low fluid-shear levels and/or limited mixing in microgravity , , . In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate that spaceflight culture conditions globally alter the gene expression profile of a eukaryotic pathogen and could potentially induce a virulence-related phenotype, and represents an initial step towards the infectious disease risk assessment of C."
"Growth and antifungal resistance of the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans, in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station: An aggregate of multiple flight experiences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8067245/,"Abstract This report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and physiological adaptations of Candida albicans cultured in microgravity on the International Space Station across several payloads. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. albicans to microgravity, this report includes an analysis of biological reproducibility across flight opportunities, compares two spaceflight hardware systems, and includes a summary of general flight and payload timelines.","A complex colony structure (HIW) had been observed in simulation experiments using the HARV bioreactor; therefore, viable cells were plated upon conclusion of the spaceflight missions to determine whether this morphological transition was also triggered in true microgravity. It appears as though aqueous solutions of AmB are less stable than CAS, which may contribute to the difference in dose dependency observed between the Micro-6 (10 days of 4 °C storage following medium preparation) and the Micro-14/FEP (17 days of storage following medium preparation) experiments, although this loss of function was not predicted by pre-flight testing. Thus, hardware that provided significant replicative capacity was restricted (for example multi-well units could not withstand the internal pressures produced by the yeast gas production) and some in-flight analyses were deemed less likely to succeed (microscopy, optical density measurements) due to the presence of extensive bubble formation."
NASA GeneLab RNA-Seq Consensus Pipeline: Standardized Processing of Short-Read RNA-Seq Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044432/,"Summary With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms exposed to spaceflight.

Direct RNA sequencing of astronaut blood reveals spaceflight-associated m6A increases and hematopoietic transcriptional responses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166648/,"Abstract The advent of civilian spaceflight challenges scientists to precisely describe the effects of spaceflight on human physiology, particularly at the molecular and cellular level. Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can quantitatively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single molecule resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA nanopore sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole blood sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven timepoints, spanning pre-flight, day of return, and post-flight recovery. These data and results represent the first longitudinal long-read RNA profiles and RNA modification maps for each gene for astronauts, improving our understanding of the human transcriptome’s dynamic response to spaceflight.","Although many categories of significantly up-regulated pathways were observed, exposure to space radiation in particular may underlie a number of cancer-related pathways, including “TSAI response to radiation therapy” and “Wiemann telomere shortening and chronic liver damage.” The set of downregulated pathways after landing was distinct, and notably included genes associated with breathing regulation (e.g., CO 2 and O 2 takeup and release by erythrocytes). Additionally, the associated differential expression callers, DESeq2 and edgeR, respectively, utilize slightly different heuristics to perform log 2 fold change estimates, resulting in many genes uniquely identified by the salmon-edgeR pipeline mapping to the y -axis of Fig. Moreover, given the civilian background of the I4 astronauts, we note that transcriptomic changes can be confounded with age, biological sex, preflight preparation differences, or divergent postflight recovery procedures, and thus utilized tools that aim to model and normalize such variation."
Collection of biospecimens from the inspiration4 mission establishes the standards for the space omics and medical atlas (SOMA),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166662/,"Biospecimen samples were collected from four crew members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during (Flight Day: FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) spaceflight, spanning a total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The collection process included venous whole blood, capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This paper provides an overview of the extensive biospecimen collection and highlights their processing procedures and long-term biobanking techniques, facilitating future molecular tests and evaluations.As such, this study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high-quality human, microbial, and environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) initiative, which can aid future human spaceflight and space biology experiments.","Select, targeted measures in clinical labs (CLIA) were also performed immediately after sample collection (CBC, CMP), and samples and viable cells were preserved in a long-term Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank, such that additional assays and measures can be conducted in the future. Although the all-civilian I4 crew pioneered the first use of the SOMA protocols, the methodology outlined here is robust and generalizable, making it applicable to future astronaut crews from any commercial mission provider (e.g., SpaceX, Axiom Space, Sierra Space, Blue Origin) or space agencies (NASA, ESA, JAXA, ROSCOSMOS). Furthermore, the SOMA banking, sequencing, and processing methods are a springboard for continuing biospecimen analysis and expanding our knowledge of multi-omic dynamics before, during, and after human spaceflight missions, providing a molecular roadmap for crew health, medical biometrics, and possible countermeasures."
Microfluidics-enabled method to identify modes of Caenorhabditis elegans paralysis in four anthelmintics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3838407/,"The area of microfluidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern recognition. In most microfluidic devices, drug effects on small animals (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans ) are quantified by an end-point, dose response curve representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or stroke frequency). We quantified worm behavior with parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. Our study highlights the need for assaying drug effects on small animal models with multiple parameters quantified at regular time points over an extended period to adequately capture the resistance and adaptability in chemical environments.","Furthermore, in contrast to quantifying drug effects by the sensitivity of electric fields at pre- and post-exposure time instances, 25 we extracted parameters related to movement, immobilization, and body shapes through the period of drug exposure and attempted to show differences across four drugs. 11 In our view, this microfluidic-enabled characterization method will broaden the scope of data extraction from drug screening experiments, improve our understanding of worm resistance and adaptability in adverse chemical environments, and provide faster ways of predicting new and existing drug targets prior to detailed electrophysiological experiments. elegans and other model organisms are gaining increased attention for the rapid screening of large sets of small molecules (e.g., membrane-permeable inhibitors of protein function) that induce phenotypic changes in the worm, such as lethality, unco-ordinated movement, slow growth and development, and morphological defects."
Multiparameter behavioral analyses provide insights to mechanisms of cyanide resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3748764/,"Caenorhabditis elegans that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by the chemical nature of the toxicant. elegans behavior hold great potential as a means to monitor the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time and to study the biological networks that underpin toxicant resistance.","Microfluidics offered the opportunity to quantitate the responses to aqueous toxicants with superior spatiotemporal resolution, in a single and continuous plane of focus, at the individual worm level and in a much shorter period of time. We investigated multiple parameters, including the average velocity of the body centroid, total distance covered by the worms, behavioral raster representation of individual animals, range and distribution of mean velocities, and pausing behavior and stops. Although these data clearly show that cysl-2 has a central role in cyanide resistance, we postulate that other HIF-1 targets also contribute to the ability of egl-9 mutants to survive in the presence of this toxicant."
Growth performance and root transcriptome remodeling of Arabidopsis in response to Mars-like levels of magnesium sulfate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925951/,"Abstract Background Martian regolith (unconsolidated surface material) is a potential medium for plant growth in bioregenerative life support systems during manned missions on Mars. Methodology and Principal Findings Disabling ion transporters AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in Col-0, and also between Col-0 and the mutant line cax1-1 , which was confirmed to be relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O in soil solution. Conclusions/Significance The results provide a solid basis for the understanding of the metabolic response of plants to elevated magnesium sulfate soils; it is the first transcriptome analysis of plants in this environment.","The results in this study show that knockout mutant lines of the known genes in Arabidopsis encoding root plasma membrane based uptake transporters of Mg 2+ and SO 4 2− ions failed to confer an adaptive advantage to a MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O enriched environment. The response of CAX1 and other CAX family members in the Col-0 time series suggests that a deficiency of calcium caused by high levels of magnesium and possibly by calcium sulfate precipitation could play a major part in the reduction of plant growth performance in the presence of high magnesium sulfate concentrations. This set of genes included CAX1 , 18 genes previously associated with enhanced tolerance to broad ranges of abiotic stresses, and several well-characterized genes known to enhance tolerance to other salts like NaCl. Many of the differentially regulated genes contain promoter sequence motifs that are known to play a role in ABA-mediated regulation, such as ABRE-CE."
The 14-3-3 proteins of Arabidopsis regulate root growth and chloroplast development as components of the photosensory system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3350920/,"Abstract The 14-3-3 proteins specifically bind a number of client proteins to influence important pathways, including flowering timing via the photosensory system. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutant, 14-3-3μ-1 , had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutants all had increased root greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength and intensity. This study reveals new developmental roles of 14-3-3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association with the photosensory system.","The PHYB mutant, phyB , exhibits significantly reduced root elongation rates compared with the wild type when grown in light, but does not exhibit this same reduced root elongation rate when grown in the dark ( Correll and Kiss, 2005 ), which was also observed in this study ( Figs 1 , 2 ). The difference in 14-3-3μ-1 root length when grown in the dark compared with blue light was less distinct than comparing the difference in root length of light- and dark-grown 14-3-3μ-1 , indicating that 14-3-3μ-1 is slightly deficient in blue light signalling, a phenotype that is similar, but not as strong as in cry1 mutants ( Canamero et al. Although PHYB has not been identified as a protein binding partner of 14-3-3 proteins, phytochromes are regulated by phosphorylation, and the association of PHYB with several phosphorylation events presents many situations of possible 14-3-3 protein involvement ( Kim et al."
14-3-3 phosphoprotein interaction networks - does isoform diversity present functional interaction specification?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422896/,"Abstract The 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins and thereby constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node through which a large number of important signals pass.

However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific expression.

This is supported by microarray data from a number of studies which shows the 13 isoforms show a fairly similar expression pattern across tissues ( Dinneny et al., 2008 ; Griffiths et al., 2011 ), with the exception of 14-3-3ι where transcripts are almost completely restricted to closed flower buds ( Hennig et al., 2004 ; Figure 5 ). Functional specificity revealed by TDNA mutations Functional diversity of plant 14-3-3s is widely documented, and includes primary metabolism, abiotic and biotic stress, light-mediated processes, hormonal signaling, and basic cell growth and division (reviewed in Aitken, 2002 ; Denison et al., 2011 )."
Plant growth strategies are remodeled by spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11869762/,"Methods A hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model was established to evaluate the intestinal protective effects of GTSs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using RNA-Seq. The gut microbiome composition was examined based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the short-chain fatty acids produced were further analyzed. Results We found that GTSs intervention effectively improved the intestinal injury caused by simulated weightlessness, including reducing the pathological damage, increasing the expression of tight junction proteins and reducing the levels of inflammatory factors. Conclusion Our results revealed that GTSs improved intestinal microecological disorders and impaired immune function caused by the weightlessness simulation.","33 , 34 Although much attention has been paid to the antiviral properties of Isg15 , recent reports have also suggested that uncoupled Isg15 may act as a signalling molecule to stimulate immunomodulatory responses, such as neutrophil chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory cytokines. HE staining confirmed the pathological injury of the small intestine in the HLS group, as well as the recovery potential of GTSs. Moreover, deficiency in mucin synthesis and secretion by goblet cells directly leads to intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, are mediators of communication between intestinal signals and immune functions, accounting for more than 90% of the total intestinal SCFAs. 48 Acetic acid not only provides an important energy source for host cells but also protects intestinal epithelial cells by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins, thereby reducing intestinal permeability."
Spaceflight transcriptomes: unique responses to a novel environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10712242/,"Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µ g ) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight.

Spaceflight significantly affects plant translation machinery in an organ-specific pattern The varied abundance of over 150 ribosomal subunit proteins, spliceosomes and proteasomes in spaceflight and across both organs suggest major alterations to plant transcriptional and translation machinery as an adaptation mechanism to the spaceflight environment ( Supplementary Tables E, F ). The abundance of HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN families (HS60, HSP70, HSP90) in both organs suggests an increased control of protein homeostasis in space characterized by folding of nascent polypeptides released from the ribosome, sorting of proteins to cell organelles and providing a link to the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation."
Fundamental plant biology enabled by the space shuttle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6143729/,"A thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various stimuli encountered during spaceflight presents many economic benefits and is imperative for the health of crew. niger strains inhabiting closed systems may reveal information fundamental to the success of long-duration space missions.

Organ-specific remodeling of the Arabidopsis transcriptome in response to spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10058394/,"To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the “Oxidative Stress Response” GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. Overall, these data indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications.","The few GO groups that were similarly over-represented between shoot and root DEGs included genes that showed opposite expression responses to the microgravity environment between organs, as nicely documented by the expression differences between shoots and roots for distinct subgroups of peroxidase genes belonging to the Oxidative-Reduction Process GO group in Bd21 ( Supplemental Figure S6 ). Larger-scale investigations of root and shoot growth and expression responses to microgravity of multiple Brachypodium accessions using genome-wide association studies should, in the longer term, provide exciting new information on key loci contributing to this variation in morphological and molecular adaptive responses to microgravity. A careful evaluation of the contribution of each response, general or specific, to the microgravity environment and its significance for plant survival, growth, and productivity under microgravity should lead to the design of better cultivars and/or cultivation methodologies to produce crops with improved potential for use as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space-exploration missions."
A method for preparing spaceflight RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) tissue for scanning electron microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103452/,"Abstract • Premise of the study: In spaceflight experiments, tissues for morphologic study are fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, while tissues for molecular study are fixed in RNA later ; thus, an experiment containing both study components requires multiple fixation strategies. The possibility of using RNA later -fixed materials for standard SEM-based morphometric investigation was explored to expand the library of tissues available for analysis and maximize usage of samples returned from spaceflight, but these technologies have wide application to any situation where recovery of biological resources is limited. • Methods and Results: RNA later -fixed samples were desalinated in distilled water, dehydrated through graded methanol, plunged into liquid ethane, and transferred to cryovials for freeze-substitution. The majority of the tissues remained intact, including general morphology and finer details such as root hairs and trichomes.","Arabidopsis plants harvested on the International Space Station by astronauts were successfully retrieved from RNA later and processed to produce acceptable quality images without the use of a dedicated morphologic fixative ( Fig. With the option of using one stable, safe chemical fixative for all desired studies to be conducted upon return, scientists in the field may be able to collect more data with fewer trips.

The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware.","Likewise with the three upregulated genes encoding proteases—one encoding a Subtilase family protein that has a role in processing a cell wall pectin methylesterase, another was a member of the cystatin/monellin superfamily of proteases, a group which plays a role in pathogen resistance, and finally a ubiquitin-like protease (Senechal et al., 2014 ; van Wyk et al., 2014 ). Genes encoding proteins that play a role in the transport of amino acids (Transmembrane amino acid transporter family protein), small molecules (MATE efflux family protein, RSH2 root hair specific 2), water (TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein), sugar (SPSA1 sucrose phosphate synthase 1F), metal ions (HMA5 heavy metal ATPase 5), and protons (NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2) all had expression adjusted to levels comparable to the spaceflight transcriptome of WT cells. Examples include WD domain, G-beta repeat protein gene, SRL2 phytochrome interacting factor 4, and UNS2 Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferases (NAT) These genes are associated primarily with plant growth, cell expansion and architecture, and morphogenesis (Lehman et al., 1996 ; Schwab et al., 2003 ; Saedler et al., 2009 ; Nomoto et al., 2012 ), suggesting that the cell growth may need to be adjusted in spaceflight and that a certain level expression of development-related genes may be required."
A Member of the CONSTANS-Like Protein Family is a Putative Regulator of ROS Homeostasis and Spaceflight Physiological Adaptation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6348315/,"The OMG1 5′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding.

Phylogeny and protein architecture of OMG1 Prior to this study, members of the Arabidopsis CO and COL family were thought to only function in photoperiod signalling that involves flowering, circadian rhythms, stomata opening and root-shoot branching ( Gangappa and Botto 2014 ). This is in line with reports on the rapid evolution of COL genes within the Brassicaceae, in which the increased evolutionary rates were observed not only in the middle region of the protein but also in the conserved zinc-finger and basic CCT regions ( Lagercrantz and Axelsson 2000 )."
HSFA2 Functions in the Physiological Adaptation of Undifferentiated Plant Cells to Spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6359015/,"Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells’ physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis.","The WT cells enhanced the expression of a curculin-like (mannose-binding) lectin family protein (AT1G78860) that was previously identified among the secretory cell wall N -glycosylated proteins in a wall-bound extracellular matrix fraction during citrus pathogen invasion [ 64 ] and is described to be associated with cell wall structural changes and signaling upon biological attack. For instance, genes involved in cell elongation due to cell wall expansion such as GASA1 (At1g75750), EXLA1 (expansin-like A1, At3g45970), and GRH1 (At4g03190), a GRAS family transcription factor SCR (SCARECROW, At3g54220), which functions in asymmetric cell division, and auxin efflux carrier PIN1 (At1g73590), which is involved in the regulation of cell size, were all downregulated in the HSFA2 KO cells that had physiologically adapted to spaceflight (see Table A1 , Figure S3 in the Supplementary Material ) [ 68 , 69 ]. The MLO7 Seven transmembrane MLO family protein (At2g17430), FBS1 F-box stress induced 1 (At1g61340), ILL6 IAA-leucine resistant (ILR)-like gene 6 (At1g44350), and AtPP2-A13 PP2-A13 phloem protein 2-A13 (At3g61060) are a few examples of individual genes which respond to wounding, mechanical stress, or external stimuli that had their expression level increased in HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to match the WT spaceflight levels (see Table A3 ) [ 102 , 103 , 104 ]."
Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio: A biomarker to monitor the immune status of astronauts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667275/,"Abstract A comprehensive understanding of spaceflight factors involved in immune dysfunction and the evaluation of biomarkers to assess in-flight astronaut health are essential goals for NASA. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation.","As compared to the rodent spaceflight results (in-flight day 14), elevated neutrophils were also observed at days 14 and 30 of HU in mice ( Figures 4C and 5A ), suggesting the physical effects of fluid-shifting experienced during spaceflight and HU may stimulate the release of neutrophils into circulation; however this requires further investigation. The cause of elevated ROS in sµg may be due to: (1) cell death factors or other unknown stimulators of the oxidative burst response, (2) a mechanosensitive stress receptor in phagocytes that triggers redox imbalance ( 87 ), and/or (3) a combination of these effects. Controversially however, multiple reports have indicated lymphocytes and lymphocyte-like cell lines undergo apoptosis during spaceflight/microgravity conditions ( 36 – 42 ), albeit measurements were either reported post-landing or from ex vivo cell cultures in flight."

Immunological and hematological outcomes following protracted low dose/low dose rate ionizing radiation and simulated microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169688/,"Abstract Using a ground-based model to simulate spaceflight [21-days of single-housed, hindlimb unloading (HLU) combined with continuous low-dose gamma irradiation (LDR, total dose of 0.04 Gy)], an in-depth survey of the immune and hematological systems of mice at 7-days post-exposure was performed. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted.","Transcriptomic analysis of the spleen, which is the filter for circulating blood cells and a secondary lymphoid organ, displayed genes involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization and DNA repair pathways are altered. Yet, the overall contribution of immune responses on whole-organism physiology cannot be fully concluded until longitudinal phenotypic studies are performed, as mission timeframes vary, ground-model conditions and exposure timeframes are non-standardized, and post-mission/model tissue collections differ, which can all result in different interpretations. Since RBC do not contain a nucleus and thus genetic material, the majority of blood disease/disorder genes are likely pooled from DNA-containing immature RBC or reticulocytes, immature platelets or reticulated platelets, WBC, and other cells of the spleen, including mesothelial cells and smooth muscle cells 54 ."
Epigenomic regulators elongator complex subunit 2 and methyltransferase 1 differentially condition the spaceflight response in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475764/,"Abstract Background: Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 ( met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 ( elp2-5 )] along with a wild-type Col-0 control. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5 . In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling.","Physiological adaptation to spaceflight engages gene expression changes that at least mimic several terrestrial stress responses ( Hoson et al., 2002 ; Gao et al., 2008 ; Salmi and Roux, 2008 ; Blancaflor, 2013 ; Correll et al., 2013 ; Paul et al., 2013 ; Zupanska et al., 2013 ; Ferl et al., 2014 ; Inglis et al., 2014 ; Nakashima et al., 2014 ; Sugimoto et al., 2014 ; Kwon et al., 2015 ; Schüler et al., 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ; Barker et al., 2017 ; Choi et al., 2019 ; Kruse et al., 2020 ; Supplementary Table 2 ). In addition, the first whole-genome survey of DNA methylation in wild-type WS Arabidopsis plants grown entirely in the spaceflight environment showed correlated changes in DNA methylation accompanying regulation of DEGs in spaceflight, especially in stress response genes such as those associated with defense responses and ROS signaling ( Zhou et al., 2019 ). ELP2 regulates root growth and development, and elp2 loss of function mutants display shorter roots, and this phenotype may be linked to the root-specific involvement of DmC-DEGs associated with ion homeostasis, transport processes, and extracellular localization observed in this study ( Figures 1C , 8E; Jia et al., 2015 )."
Plants grown in Apollo lunar regolith present stress-associated transcriptomes that inform prospects for lunar exploration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9098553/,"Abstract The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in-situ resources. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations.","Plant growth in three sources of lunar regolith To provide insights into the potential for using lunar regolith to grow plants as part of the Artemis lunar exploration science program and for future sustained lunar habitation, we developed a small-scale system based on 48-well laboratory plates capable of assessing plant growth in small, obtainable amounts of lunar regolith samples returned from the Apollo missions 11, 12, and 17 (Fig. Plant transcriptomes differentiate by morphology When the gene expression data were parsed with respect to relative growth success, rather than the lunar sample site, even the more successful-looking plants (those individual plants that had a size and morphology similar to those grown in JSC-1A) demonstrated strong stress-response transcriptomes (Fig. Nine of the lunar plants were organized into three phenotypic groups of three plants each: “Severe” (tiny with distorted morphology and reddish black pigmentation throughout), “Small” (small, but green and well proportioned), and “Large” (large with respect to other regolith-grown plants, and with normal pigmentation and morphology, close to the typical JSC-1A phenotype, but still smaller than JSC-1A-grown plants)."

Utilizing the KSC fixation tube to conduct human-tended plant biology experiments on a suborbital spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9693084/,"Abstract Suborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.","Many previous plant molecular biology spaceflight-related experiments utilized Petri dishes containing a matrix nutrient gel to grow plants on the ISS in a variety of plant growth hardware systems (i.e., BRIC, Biological Research in Canister; ABRS, Advanced Biological Research System; EMCS, European Modular Cultivation System; Veggie). Additionally, at the T-10 min timepoint, an additional set of four KFTs (Q1A, Q1B, Q1C and Q1D) were actuated to assess the variability and reproducibility of the plant transcriptome simply from being housed for that amount of time in the KFTs. To understand how this methodology differs from the standard Petri dish configuration typically used in spaceflight experiments, the plant transcriptome obtained from each of the four Q1 KFTs (Q1A-D) were compared to the transcriptome from a Petri dish control at the same T-10 min timepoint. 3.2. KFT Provides a Suitable Microenvironment for Short-Term Plant Growth Root tissues from four replicate KFTs (Q1A-D) and one Petri dish (Q1P) were analyzed to investigate how plants responded to living within the KFTs for three hours and fifty minutes, in order to assay the effects of preflight sealing into the KFTs.

Post-Spaceflight (STS-135) Mouse Splenocytes Demonstrate Altered Activation Properties and Surface Molecule Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430214/,Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls.,"These native expressions found no differences observed in the percent population changes of CD4 or CD8 T cells, with results reflecting similar findings from published works showing no changes in percent population of CD4 or CD8 T cells in rodents post-spaceflight [ 32 – 34 ]. Interestingly, previous published reports examining another β2 integrin, CD11b, showed a decrease population change, interpreted as a decrease in monocytes/macrophages [ 40 ], which was also observed using CD14/16 markers for identification [ 10 ]. The data from this study shed additional light towards molecular mechanisms involved in immune changes induced by spaceflight that could alter activation of innate and adaptive immunity, at least post flight."
Changes in the distribution and function of leukocytes after whole-body iron ion irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5045078/,"Radiation consistently increased thymus mass (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.005); spleen, liver and lung masses were similar among all groups. However, the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cell count and percentage all decreased, while both the CD4:CD8 (Th:Tc) cell ratio and spontaneous blastogenesis increased, in one or more irradiated groups compared with unirradiated controls ( P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). In contrast, splenic WBC, lymphocyte, B cell and T helper (Th) counts, %B cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were all significantly elevated, while Tc percentages decreased, in one or more of the irradiated groups compared with controls ( P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Collectively, the data indicate that significant immunological abnormalities still exist more than a month after 56 Fe irradiation and that there are differences dependent upon body compartment.","In a previous study, we found 56 Fe dose-dependent decreases in blood WBCs and in all three major leukocyte types on Day 4 post-irradiation, followed by complete recovery in cell numbers by Day 113; monocyte–macrophage percentages, however, were significantly decreased in both blood and spleen [ 36 ]. Although statistical support was not always obtained, the consistently high numbers of WBCs and of the major leukocyte types (especially lymphocytes) in spleens of the irradiated mice further supports the premise that hematopoiesis was still continuing above a normal level. Based on a study of bone marrow cell phenotypes in mice shortly after a 13-day mission in space, the results suggested that the spaceflight mice had more differentiated cells within the very large and granular population compared with ground controls [ 16 ] More research is obviously needed on the status of hematopoiesis and tissue regeneration in various body compartments under spaceflight conditions."
Is spaceflight-induced immune dysfunction linked to systemic changes in metabolism?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5443495/,"Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function.","While the decrease noted in cysteinyl-glycine (cys-gly) suggests that there may be less GSH breakdown with spaceflight, there were no significant changes in any of the quantified γ-glutamyl amino acids, nor in any other metabolic components of the cycle, including 5-oxoproline, glutamate, cysteine, or glycine. Since corticosterone is synthesized and released in the adrenal cortex and most endocrine tissues have tightly regulated homeostatic mechanisms that keep tissue levels within small discrete ranges (i.e., the amount of hormone being made is the same amount as that being released–allostasis), measuring adrenal corticosterone is not equivalent to measuring it in the blood or other organs. This suggests that the small difference in adrenal corticosterone levels between treatment groups reported here, despite fairly consistent increases found in other tissues, may actually be due to an increase in corticosterone synthesis in the adrenal cortex to compensate for increased corticosterone secretion into the circulation."
Spaceflight Activates Autophagy Programs and the Proteasome in Mouse Liver,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666744/,"Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment.","Here, we performed unsupervised Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) using the entire metabolomics dataset to determine whether 13.5 days of exposure to the space environment was sufficient to induce significant changes in metabolism in livers of mice flown in space (FLT) as compared with matched ground controls (AEM). Many of the most striking changes in metabolite and transcript abundances appeared to be related to increased dehydration of the FLT mice as compared to AEM controls; although this is a possible limitation of the study, a recent proteomics study on livers from male mice in the “Bion-M1” study flown in space for 30 days and re-acclimated showed results similar to those from our previously published data [ 22 ]. We found significant upregulation in expression of a number of genes, including Atg2a , important for autophagosome formation as well as regulation of lipid droplet morphology and dispersion; microtubule-associated genes ( Map1lc3a , Map1lc3b ); Wipi1 and 2 , involved in pre-autophagosome formation and the autophagy response to starvation; and Mtor , a central mediator of cellular response to stressors such as DNA damage and oxidative stress, supporting our GSEA results ( Table 3 )."
Vive la radior√©sistance!: Converging research in radiobiology and biogerontology to enhance human radioresistance for deep space exploration and colonization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865701/,"Abstract While many efforts have been made to pave the way toward human space colonization, little consideration has been given to the methods of protecting spacefarers against harsh cosmic and local radioactive environments and the high costs associated with protection from the deleterious physiological effects of exposure to high-Linear energy transfer (high-LET) radiation. Herein, we lay the foundations of a roadmap toward enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes of deep space colonization and exploration. We outline future research directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. We conclude by presenting the known associations between radioresistance and longevity, and articulating the position that enhancing human radioresistance is likely to extend the healthspan of human spacefarers as well.","We have outlined several alternative and complementary strategies for enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes of deep space exploration and colonization using existing biomedical and biotechnological tools and modalities in an attempt to lay the foundation for a comprehensive roadmap towards highly radioresistant humans. Meanwhile, we have highlighted the link between radioresistance and aging, and have endeavored to show how many of the biomedical and biotechnological modalities discussed in the present review could combinatorially be applied to both enhancing human radioresistance on the one hand and healthy longevity on the other. Furthermore, given the massive amount of funding allocated to research into facilitating and optimizing space exploration and optimization, we hope to have shown how research into enhancing radioresistance for space exploration could galvanize progress in human healthspan extension, an area of research that is still massively underfunded despite its potential to prevent the massive economic burden posed by the future healthcare costs associated with demographic aging."
Proteomic analysis of mouse brain subjected to spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6337482/,"Within 3–5 h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. While there was no overlap between the white and gray matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space missions.","While there do not appear to be enough significantly different proteins in either white or gray matter in this analysis to appear as a significantly activated canonical pathway, there still appear to be common functional themes: (1) synaptic function, (2) intracellular communication, (3) metabolism, (4) oxidative stress and tissue damage responses, and (5) activation of catecholamines. Similarly, dynein light chain LC8-type 2 (DYNLL2, also known as DLC2), originally identified as part of the microtubule-based motor protein dynein [ 54 ], is involved with transporting mitochondria along the axons of neurons in response to local energy and metabolic requirements [ 55 ]. However, in our previous study examining the livers of these same mice, there were significant changes in lipid metabolism indicative of a pre-diabetic state that seems to suggest a long-term effect rather than an acute response due to landing [ 32 , 59 , 80 ]."
Transcriptomic effects on the mouse heart following 30 days on the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9953463/,"Abstract Efforts to understand the impact of spaceflight on the human body stem from growing interest in long-term space travel. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight. Keywords: International Space Station, spaceflight, transcriptomics, cardiovascular system, RNA sequencing, adaptive response, signaling, oxidative stress","To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to use an in vivo model to focus on the effects of long-term (30 day) spaceflight on gene expression, molecular pathways, and cellular changes occurring in the heart. Because it is well accepted that microgravity can increase the concentration of reactive oxygen species [ 52 ], it is possible that the oxidant nature of ROS further activates Ras/MAPK cascades that respond to stress signals and create a balanced system through the increased transcription of antioxidants [ 37 ]. The ability of the heart to adapt to the space environment after long-term spaceflight is one possible explanation for the lack of differences in ROS and oxidative stress when comparing the flight and ground control groups in our study."
Spaceflight-induced gene expression profiles in the mouse brain are attenuated by treatment with the antioxidant BuOE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10487739/,"Abstract The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.","To obtain insights into the biological processes being affected in the brain by spaceflight, we performed pathway analyses on the spaceflight-induced DEGs. Interestingly, several pathways known to be altered by oxidative stress were significantly enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight: VEGF signaling [ 41 ] in CA, calcium signaling [ 42 ] in DG, FoxO signaling [ 43 ] in FCT, and ECM-receptor interaction [ 44 ] in CT. Longitudinal metabolomic profiles revealed sex-specific perturbations in glucose and amino acid metabolism that result from the stressors of long-duration spaceflight [ 48 ]; therefore, follow-up studies on sexually dimorphic transcriptional responses to spaceflight in the brain may be warranted. Treatment with BuOE reversed spaceflight-induced changes in transcription of a substantial number of DEGs, and a statistically significant number of spaceflight-induced DEGs changed in the opposite direction as did BuOE-induced DEGs, suggesting that BuOE may be effective in attenuating at least some of the effects of spaceflight stress on the brain."
Basal signaling regulates plant growth and development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11942576/,"Abstract The proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase ( PERK ) gene family is crucial to various molecular and cellular processes in plants. Gene structure and motif analyses revealed variations among the BnPERK family members, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Expression profiling showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis perk9 mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune response, suggesting the negative role of PERK9 in plant immunity.","Despite their significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive study on the molecular functions of PERKs, particularly when compared with other RLKs. While genome-wide analyses of PERK genes have been conducted in some species [ 11 , 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 ], a thorough study of the BnPERK gene family has yet to be published. This rapid and robust response to IAA, ET, GA, CK, and BL suggested that BnPERK genes might play a crucial role in the early stages of hormonal signal transduction in leaves, possibly by mediating the downstream effects of these hormones. The differential expression patterns of BnPERK genes in response to various hormone treatments highlight their potential involvement in diverse physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and defense mechanisms."
Phosphoinositide-signaling is one component of a robust plant defense response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4052902/,"Abstract The phosphoinositide pathway and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP 3 ) have been implicated in plant responses to many abiotic stresses; however, their role in response to biotic stress is not well characterized. In the current study, we show that both basal defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are affected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) which have greatly reduced InsP 3 levels. Reciprocal exudate experiments showed that although the InsP 5-ptase plants produced equally effective molecules that could trigger PR-1 gene expression in wild type plants, exudates collected from either wild type or InsP 5-ptase plants triggered less PR-1 gene expression in InsP 5-ptase plants. Additionally, expression profiles indicated that several defense genes including PR-1 , PR-2 , PR-5 , and AIG1 were basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared with wild type.","There are shared similarities in the response of the cas-1 mutant and the InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants in defense signaling, such as increased susceptibility to both virulent and avirulent bacterial strains, basally reduced PR-1 gene expression and normal ROS generation in response to flg22. SA biosynthesis and SA mediated signaling InsP 5-ptase plants have low basal SA (under normal control conditions) and when infected with avirulent pathogens, SA levels were lower than wild type plants at day 2 post inoculation (Figure 4 ), suggesting that SA biosynthesis maybe reduced in the transgenic plants. Accumulation of SA affects the cellular redox and controls the translocation of the cofactor NPR1 into the nucleus where it binds and activates TGAs. Most TGAs act as positive regulators to induce PR genes as well as the expression of genes encoding ER resident proteins involved in protein folding and Ca 2+ storage."
Uncovering transcriptional responses to fractional gravity in Arabidopsis roots,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8539686/,"Abstract Although many reports characterize the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis seedlings to microgravity, few investigate the effect of partial or fractional gravity on gene expression. The plant signaling flight experiment utilized the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EMCS consisted of two rotors within a controlled chamber allowing for two experimental conditions, microgravity (stationary rotor) and simulated gravity in space. To investigate whether gene expression patterns are sensitive to fractional g , we carried out transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed to microgravity or partial g (ranging from 0.53 to 0.88 g ).","When the fractional g gradient across the samples in the actively spinning rotor is considered, 101 genes exhibited dose-associated expression levels that occurred in one of three different patterns of expression: (1) a dose-dependent linear increase or decrease, (2) a “peak up” or “peak down” response where expression levels peak or dip at an intermediate g level, and (3) a threshold response where expression levels are induced (or repressed) to a threshold g level. In addition to heat stress, heat shock proteins are associated with a wide range of plant stress responses including: salinity, drought, cold temperatures, flooding, heavy metal exposure, pathogen interactions, and spaceflight stressors [ 7 , 65 ]. The authors subjected Arabidopsis seedlings to repeated mechanical stimulation (at three different time points, 0, 12, and 24 h) and compared the transcriptional response of several mutants (affected in mitochondrial function or regulation) to wild type seedlings."
Conserved plant transcriptional responses to microgravity from two consecutive spaceflight experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10800490/,"Methods Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). Results and discussion An RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR revealed a significant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity between the two experiments. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity.","Nevertheless, when we compare our findings with other spaceflight experiments, we find that two common features stand out; many experiments have reported altered expression of genes involved in cell wall modification and photosynthesis/plastid related genes. Furthermore the seed cassettes provide a controlled optimal environment for seedling growth with sufficient lighting, moisture and humidity without inherent spaceflight associated limitations of water delivery that are manifest in larger plant growth habitats. While the proteome may be a more direct readout of response, spaceflight experiments frequently have insufficient amounts of tissue for large scale proteomic studies; additional hurdles include the cost and the paucity of well annotated reference protein databases."
RNAseq analysis of rodent spaceflight experiments is confounded by sample collection techniques,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7756143/,"Summary To understand the physiological changes that occur in response to spaceflight, mice are transported to the International Space Station (ISS) and housed for variable periods of time before euthanasia on-orbit or return to Earth. We found large changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. Changes due to preservation method eclipsed those between flight and ground samples, making it difficult to identify spaceflight-specific changes. Follow-on experiments to interrogate the roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods suggested that differences due to preservation protocols are exacerbated when coupled with polyA selection.","To understand the physiological changes that occur in response to spaceflight, mice are transported to the International Space Station (ISS) and housed for variable periods of time before euthanasia on-orbit or return to Earth.

Functional changes in the snail statocyst system elicited by microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3066201/,"This system has clear similarities to its vertebrate counterparts: a weight-lending mass, an epithelial layer containing small supporting cells and the large sensory hair cells, and an output eliciting compensatory body reflexes to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings In terrestrial gastropod snail we studied the impact of 16- (Foton M-2) and 12-day (Foton M-3) exposure to microgravity in unmanned orbital missions on: (i) the whole animal behavior ( Helix lucorum L.), (ii) the statoreceptor responses to tilt in an isolated neural preparation ( Helix lucorum L.), and (iii) the differential expression of the Helix pedal peptide (HPep) and the tetrapeptide FMRFamide genes in neural structures ( Helix aspersa L.). A significant increase in mRNA expression of the gene encoding HPep, a peptide linked to ciliary beating, in statoreceptors was observed in postflight snails; no differential expression of the gene encoding FMRFamide, a possible neurotransmission modulator, was observed. Conclusions/Significance Upregulation of statocyst function in snails following microgravity exposure parallels that observed in vertebrates suggesting fundamental principles underlie gravi-sensing and the organism's ability to adapt to gravity changes.","Taking into account the known effect of pedal peptide on cilia beating and muscle contraction , we can assume that it might play an important role in the regulation of mechanical transduction processes of the hair bundles of statoreceptors, such as regulation of actin-myosin complex within the cilia – , and the observed change in expression of gene encoding pedal peptide ( Table 2 ) suggests existence of lasting influence of the flight. The test mass (utricular or saccular otolith or statolith) of the fresh-water pond snail, Biomphalaria glabrata , marine mollusk, Aplysia californica , Xenopus , , newt , and swordtail fish reared in space increased relative to ground-reared controls. In the toadfish efferent vestibular neurons directly inhibit the hair cell by shunting its membrane potential and at the same time increase the afferent firing rate , thereby effectively enhancing signal processing, for example, during large and rapid escape or feeding behaviors."
Simulated microgravity impairs human NK [natural killer] cell cytotoxic activity against space radiation-relevant leukemic cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11324864/,"Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.","The fact that a significant further decrease in killing was not observed in continuous sμG when K-562 cells were used as targets raises the possibility that the exclusive use of this optimized target cell line with its exquisite sensitivity to NK lysis has the potential to mask important yet subtle effects various stressors may exert on NK function and highlights the importance of including additional target cell lines in future studies. When combined with our prior report of human T-ALL in mice repopulated with human HSC that had been exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions 13 , the further reduction in cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells against T-ALL when maintained in conditions of sμG raises the troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may have the potential to increase astronaut risk of this hematological malignancy, and perhaps others, during prolonged missions beyond LEO. Importantly from the standpoint of astronaut safety, RNA-seq analysis performed on primary NK cells from two different healthy human donors revealed that multiple pathways that are central to NK function are altered by exposure to sμG, paving the way for future studies to test agents designed to target these specific pathways to serve as much-needed medical countermeasures that can mitigate the microgravity-induced deficits in NK function, enabling astronaut immune systems to effectively recognize and eliminate any malignant clones that arise as a result mutations induced by exposure to space radiation."
Multi-analyte biochip (MAB) based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrodes (ASSISE) for physiological research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665236/,"Abstract Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications in environmental, biomedical, agricultural, biological, and spaceflight research require an ion-selective electrode (ISE) that can withstand prolonged storage in complex biological media 1-4 . To extend the ASSISE working lifetime and thereby maintain stable potentials at the interfacial layers, we utilized the conductive polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) 7-9 in place of silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the transducer layer. The MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on Earth or in space.

The application of ASSISEs is not limited to ion sensors; the CP conjugates can be functionalized with biomolecules and the MAB can function as a biosensor. Owing to the long functional working lifetime demonstrated with the ISEs for H + ions, the MAB is suitable for applications that require long-term monitoring in a complex biological liquid medium environment."
Lab-on-a-chip approaches for space-biology research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10470837/,"Despite the recent advances in propulsion and life support technologies, there is a growing need to perform analytical measurements and laboratory experiments across diverse domains of science, while keeping low payload requirements. Although non-invasive molecular diagnostics, like lab-on-a-chip technology, are expected to improve the quality of long-term space missions, their application to monitor microbiological and environmental variables is rarely reported, even for analogous extreme environments on Earth. The possibility of evaluating the occurrence of unknown or unexpected species, identifying redox gradients relevant to microbial metabolism, or testing for specific possible biosignatures, will play a key role in the future of space microbiology. In this review, we will examine the current and potential roles of lab-on-a-chip technology in space exploration and in extreme environment investigation, reporting what has been tested so far, and clarifying the direction toward which the newly developed technologies of portable lab-on-a-chip sensors are heading for exploration in extreme environments and in space.","Microfluidic technology is a good example and the best way to accelerate processes in science and industry today, and it will soon transform the entire industry ( Krishen, 2009 ; Hessel et al., 2020 ). In this review, currently used systems for detection of analytes in extreme environments and space exploration were discussed, suggesting PoC and LoC approaches represent the best choice. However, new advances in the fields of engineering, nanomaterials and electronics can improve durability, reversibility, sensitivity, and selectivity of the analytical devices, supporting the development of next-generation systems suitable for harsh environment investigation and space exploration."
Plant chemical genomics: gravity sensing and response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10386755/,"Abstract The first genome sequenced of a eukaryotic organism was for Saccharomyces cerevisiae , as reported in 1996, but it was more than 10 years before any of the zygomycete fungi, which are the early-diverging terrestrial fungi currently placed in the phyla Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota , were sequenced. Genomic data from these early-diverging terrestrial fungi revealed deep phylogenetic separation of the two major clades—primarily plant—associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizal Mucoromycota versus the primarily mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in the Zoopagomycota . Genomic studies provide many valuable insights into how these fungi evolved in response to the challenges of living on land, including adaptations to sensing light and gravity, development of hyphal growth, and co-existence with the first terrestrial plants. Genome sequence data have facilitated studies of genome architecture, including a history of genome duplications and horizontal gene transfer events, distribution and organization of mating type loci, rDNA genes and transposable elements, methylation processes, and genes useful for various industrial applications.","While the quality of the genomes varies according to the sequencing platform and starting materials available, the genomes are sufficient for phylogenomic reconstructions, as well as for the discovery of functional genes and gene clusters of interest. Much of the work has focused on several key topics, including the evolution and phylogeny of the group, adaptation, and transition to a terrestrial habitat (e.g., light and gravity sensors, and reinforcement of cell-wall structure to tolerate a nonaquatic environment), genome duplication, endosymbionts and horizontal gene transfer, genome architecture, pathogenicity, and coevolution with host species. The number of genomes has grown rapidly over the past decade, and we expect that the next decade will bring increased taxon sampling (e.g., new genomes for taxa that have not yet been sampled) and improvements in genome quality due to advances in long-read sequencing technologies and bioinformatics approaches."
The interaction of vortical flows with red cells in venous valve mimics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8896891/,"The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing microfluidic devices. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.","Unlike other studies where RBCs were used to follow fluid streamlines, in this work, the fluid vortices were tracked with smaller particles of size similar to that of platelets (1 μ m) and stiffer than the RBCs. Our observation at Re = 3 and 6 implies that while RBCs may not enter the valve pockets at these low flow rates, smaller platelets may preferentially enter the valve regions. 24,30,31 Our results show that platelet margination can be a flow-driven phenomenon by transport along the streamlines and can happen independent of volume exclusion or due to collisions with RBCs. 22,32,33 Flow separation results in atypical wall shear stress The presence of forward and reversing velocity profiles due to flow separation shown in Fig. As expected, the strains continue to decrease as the fluid enters the sudden expansion, and at any given location, increases with an increase in Re. Since we observed flow separation at Re = 3 and 6, but RBCs do not enter the vortices at these flow rates, we propose that a shear rate lower than the maximum value at Re = 6 (∼1.8 × 10 5 s −1 ) is not sufficient to drive the RBC into the vortex [ Fig."
Mammalian and Invertebrate Models as Complementary Tools for Gaining Mechanistic Insight on Muscle Responses to Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8430797/,"One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on Earth. In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies.","Analysis of the transcriptomic response in the EDL from space flown animals reveals enrichment and overrepresentation of gene sets involved in necrosis, wound healing, immune response, and proliferation, which altogether may suggest a compensatory proliferation in reaction to cell damage. Analysis of the transcriptome of the gastrocnemius from space flown rodents and a time-matched HU study revealed differences in transcriptomic signatures between these two models, particularly in the direction of regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, circadian rhythm, endothelial cell adhesion, and motor neuron signaling. The use of appropriate housing controls and introduction of manipulations in controls that consider the additional handling associated with sending payloads to space (e.g., transport in ground vehicles, landing forces, light-dark cycle changes) may minimize the confounding factors when comparing findings from ground-based versus spaceflight rodent studies."
Investigation of simulated microgravity effects on Streptococcus mutans physiology and global gene expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5460135/,"Abstract Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis.

RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth.","Although the effects of both spaceflight and microgravity analog growth on virulence-related phenotypes of bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Staphylococcus aureus have been well-described, 28 – 38 comparatively little research has been dedicated to studying the specific effects of space flight and simulated microgravity on virulence attributes of oral bacteria such as S. Furthermore, expression of PTS system genes involved in transport of carbohydrates (glucose, mannitol, trehalose, mannose and cellobiose) was significantly upregulated during simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs, and other aspects of protein translation was decreased in the microgravity cultures at this time point (Fig. 29 Although great care was taken in each experiment to vigorously vortex all samples prior to and during serial dilution plating, we cannot exclude the possibility that sucrose-dependent cell clumping may have masked more apparent growth differences between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity end-point HARV cultures in these studies."

The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system).","Similar to this, experiments previously conducted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated that this bacterium achieved increased final cell density (as measured by flow cytometry of fixed cells) in flight cultures relative to ground controls under the specific growth medium characteristics of low phosphate and low oxygen availability 39 . aureus samples also exhibited several features congruent with a transition to catabolism of non-preferred carbon sources, including decreased abundance of extracellular glucose, increased abundance of gene transcripts and/or proteins encoding various sugar transporters, and increased protein abundance and/or gene expression of TCA cycle enzymes. aureus spaceflight samples may have altered metabolism (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, and transport of non-preferred carbon sources, and decreased glycolysis/fermentation and translation machinery) relative to ground-control cultures."
Homotypic vacuole fusion requires VTI11 and is regulated by phosphoinositides,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6126739/,"Their roles include regulation of stomata movements, protein storage in seeds, gravity sensing, and ion homeostasis. Vacuole or lysosome fusion in eukaryotes is mediated by two multisubunit complexes, SNARE and homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS), but only the SNARE complex is well characterized in plants. Here, we show that, similar to other eukaryotes, HOPS mediates vacuole fusion in plants by interaction with SNAREs and that the HOPS subunit VPS33 and the SNARE protein SYP22 display the sites for interaction between these complexes. In contrast to other eukaryotes, however, plant HOPS recruitment to liposomes is inhibited by phosphoinositides, which appear to define strict rules for regulating fusion and fragmentation of dynamic vacuoles.","Interestingly, Wm treatment resulted in significant dissociation of VPS41-GFP from the tonoplast, which could result from rapid depletion of PtdIns(3,5)P 2 specifically in the tonoplast if both synthesis is stalled due to the unavailability of its precursor and active dephosphorylation by SAC phosphatases ( 73 ). It is tempting to speculate that these roles of PtdIns(3,5)P 2 in promoting vacuole fragmentation in guard cells during stomata closure result from its inhibitory effect on VPS33 and VPS41 recruitment to sites of apposing vacuole membranes, which would be otherwise available for fusion.

REGULATOR OF BULB BIOGENESIS1 (RBB1) Is Involved in Vacuole Bulb Formation in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411111/,"Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We characterized regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 ( rbb1-1 ), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control. rbb1-1 mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes.","We can not discard the possibility that the GFP fusion enhances the stability of the bulbs in rbb1-1 , but rbb1 mutant alleles comprise a sensitized genetic background for studying the formation and regulation of these structures, which are quite elusive under normal conditions. Therefore, we propose an alternative model for bulb biogenesis in which a bulb forms when a TVS initiates but fails to elongate and the bulb functions as a mean to accommodate tonoplast membranes and cytoskeletal proteins that may have accumulated at the initiation site, until the bulb membrane is reabsorbed back into the tonoplast. That RBB1 is expressed as a full-length transcript of 8,957 bp is supported by several ESTs as well as the alignment of RNAseq reads spanning the entire coding sequence by the Integrated Genome Browser [ 52 , 53 ]."

Microgravity enhances the phenotype of Arabidopsis zigzag-1 and reduces the Wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion in root cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9445043/,"Abstract The spaceflight environment of the International Space Station poses a multitude of stresses on plant growth including reduced gravity. Plants exposed to microgravity and other conditions on the ISS display root skewing, changes in gene expression and protein abundance that may result in changes in cell wall composition, antioxidant accumulation and modification of growth anisotropy. Systematic studies that address the effects of microgravity on cellular organelles are lacking but altered numbers and sizes of vacuoles have been detected in previous flights. Wortmannin was used to induce vacuole fusion in seedlings and a formaldehyde-based fixation protocol was developed to visualize plant vacuole morphology after sample return, using confocal microscopy.","Imaging of plant cells with high resolution requires high numerical aperture objectives with short working distances which require specimens be mounted on slides, something that would require a large amount of astronaut time. We were able to obtain good quality fixations in both genotypes that allowed us to quantify vacuoles in sufficient seedlings, but it is important to emphasize that the fixation quality was still diminished compared to similar fixation protocols outside the BRIC-PDFU hardware even on earth. A further challenge of the PDFU hardware that might impinge on fixation quality is the low precision of the volumes used to fill the dual chamber of PDFUs. Our study demonstrated that variations from the 1:1 ratio of AGM to fixative can dramatically alter the fixation quality of plant specimens."
Hypergravity disruption of homeorhetic adaptations to lactation in rat dams include changes in circadian clocks,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3509447/,"Summary Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation (hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and reproductive systems.

Intrauterine exposure to maternal stress alters Bdnf IV DNA methylation and telomere length in the brain of adult rat offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5600826/,"Abstract DNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosines) and changes in telomere length (TTAGGG repeats on the ends of chromosomes) are two molecular modifications that result from stress and could contribute to the long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal stress on offspring behavior. Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation ( Bdnf IV ) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes.","Studying PN21 and PN80 male offspring of pregnant rats subjected to a different variable stress paradigm (beginning on G14, dams were subjected to a mixture of restraint stress, forced swim, cold exposure, social stress, and light exposure overnight) than the one we employed here, another lab found that prenatally stressed males at both ages had higher Bdnf IV DNA methylation in the amygdala and hippocampus (only a site-specific change at PN80) ( Boersma et al., 2014 ). Studying PN75 male offspring of pregnant mice subjected to restraint stress under bright light conditions (45 minutes three times per day from G7 through delivery), another lab observed significantly higher levels of methylation (as well as hydroxymethylation) for DNA associated with Bdnf IV in the frontal cortex ( Dong et al., 2015 ). Nonetheless, data altogether are consistent with the notion that stress experienced by the dam is able to produce long-term epigenetic changes in offspring at a gene well-linked to neuroplasticity and cognition (e.g.( Bekinschtein et al., 2008 ; Dincheva et al., 2016 ; Martinowich et al., 2007 ; McEwen et al., 2015 )) and mental health (e.g.( Fuchikami et al., 2011 ; Keller et al., 2010 ; Perroud et al., 2013 ; Smith et al., 2011 ))."

Brassinazole resistant 1 (BZR1)-dependent brassinosteroid signalling pathway leads to ectopic activation of quiescent cell division and suppresses columella stem cell differentiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4507784/,"Highlight Brassinosteroids (BRs) lead to ectopic activation of quiescent centre division as well as modulation of the columella stem cells differentiation in Arabidopsis roots in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner. Key words: Auxin, brassinosteroid, BZR1, columella stem cell, PINs, quiescent centre (QC), root apical meristem, root development.","Supporting this model for BR-induced down-regulation of PIN genes in roots and the resulting antagonistic action of BR against auxin-induced CSC differentiation, it was recently proposed that oppositely patterned and antagonistic actions of BR and auxin maintain the stem cell balance and optimal root growth ( Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015 ). Decoding the BR-dependent regulatory network in a cell-type specific manner remains a significant challenge, and any information will be useful in mapping BR interactomes with different pathways and uncovering how distinct tissues are coordinated ( Fridman and Savaldi-Goldstein, 2013 ). Thus, one useful approach would be to develop BR-specific sensors (reporters) and monitor real-time spatiotemporal changes in BR abundance in a cell or a tissue and perform computational modelling to establish BR distribution circuits during the developmental progress."
Proteomic study of microsomal proteins reveals a key role for Arabidopsis Annexin 1 in mediating heat stress-induced increase in intracellular calcium levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349987/,"Abstract To understand the early signaling steps in the response of plant cells to increased environmental temperature, 2-D difference gel electrophoresis was used to study the proteins in microsomes of Arabidopsis seedlings that are regulated early during heat stress. Functional studies show loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog AtANN2 were more sensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressing AtANN1 showed more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in ann1/ann2 double mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) is greatly impaired in the ann1 mutant and almost undetectable in ann1/ann2 double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is important in regulating the heat-induced increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyt and in the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress.","Prior reports showed this increase is regulated by plasma membrane-localized cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) ( 8 , 9 ) and phospholipase C9 (PLC9) ( 26 ), but there may be other calcium channels or membrane-localized proteins involved in regulating this rapid and dynamic change in [Ca 2+ ] cyt in response to HS treatment. There are numerous reports documenting AtANN1 functions as a calcium-permeable channel-like protein in response to abiotic stress, but most of the data was obtained from patch clamp experiments of spheroplasts and protoplasts of root epidermal cells ( 23 , 24 , 34 ). Although it is still unresolved whether AtANN1 acts directly as a calcium-permeable channel in vivo or facilitates this calcium transport by some other mechanism ( 35 , 36 , 37 ), our results strongly suggest that in addition to previously characterized calcium-permeable channels, annexins are a significant component of the molecular machinery that promotes the heat-induced increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyt ."
Apyrase inhibitors enhance the ability of diverse fungicides to inhibit the growth of different plant-pathogenic fungi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6638264/,"In this study, we found that the addition of the same or related apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of different fungicides to inhibit the growth of five different pathogenic fungi in plate growth assays. However, when these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative to their application alone. Overall, among the 60 treatment combinations tested (five pathogens, four apyrase inhibitors, three fungicides), the addition of apyrase inhibitors increased significantly the sensitivity of fungi to the fungicide treatments in 53 of the combinations. Consistent with their predicted mode of action, inhibitors AI.1, AI.10 and AI.13 each increased the level of propiconazole retained in one of the fungi, suggesting that they could partially block the ability of efflux transporters to remove propiconazole from these fungi.","However, when these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative to their application alone.

ANN1 and ANN2 Function in Post-Phloem Sugar Transport in Root Tips to Affect Primary Root Growth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130020/,ANN1 and ANN2 regulate Arabidopsis primary root growth by facilitating post-phloem transport of sugar in root tips.,"ANN1 and ANN2 Knockout Seedlings Show Suc-Dependent Phenotypes The observation that significantly higher contents of soluble sugar were detected by GC/MS analysis in primary roots of ann1-2 and ann2-1 compared to those of wild type when grown together without Suc indicated there was successful phloem transport of sugar from shoots to roots in the knockout mutants, yet the mutants had obvious growth and columella cell defects. For example, overexpression of the HIGHER YIELD RICE gene encoding an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR transcription factor leads to increased root length, branching, and strength, which in turn promotes photosynthesis in leaves ( Ambavaram et al., 2014 ). Because roots can communicate their nutrient status to shoots and induce responses in them ( Ko and Helariutta, 2017 ), the stress of sugar starvation in root tips could initiate a root-to-shoot signal, just as salt stress in roots promote the propagation of Ca 2+ waves from roots to shoots ( Choi et al., 2014 ; Evans et al., 2016 )."
Mitochondria-targeted human catalase in the mouse longevity MCAT model mitigates head-tilt bedrest-induced neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9695374/,"Abstract Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth.","Sex differences are an important factor in the hippocampal stress response; thus, we plan to explore these responses to simulated spaceflight in our future studies and to assess if similar results will be seen in males. Chronic stress is a risk factor for various mental and degenerative disorders, both the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system are activated and elicit glucocorticoids and noradrenaline, respectively. It is still unclear if cytokines drive stress-induced sickness behaviors or are a consequence of it, but since the impact of these changes is crucial to many behavioral pathologies, finding more links between immune and behavior changes is important for developing more specific therapies."
Structural and functional properties of bone are compromised in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6141014/,"Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation. SOD1 G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (−54%), thinner trabeculae (−41%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (−17%) and cortical area (−18%) compared to control mice (all p<0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1 G93A mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (−27%) and failure moment (−41%), along with decreased fracture toughness (−18%) (all p<0.001). This is the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of end-stage ALS mice, and imply multiple mechanisms for increased skeletal fragility and fracture risk in patients in ALS.","While reduced bone strength is likely largely secondary to impairments in skeletal muscle function in ALS SOD1 G93A mice, clinical studies suggest that the skeletal deficits may occur independent of skeletal muscle deficits, as the increased incidence of bone fractures precedes the ALS diagnosis by as much as 10 years ( 1 , 22 ). Finally, since SOD1 G93A mutation is only presented in a small fraction of ALS patients, other mouse models with different genetic mutations (C9orf72, TDP-43, FUS, VCP) that also lead to ALS should be examined to determine if bone functional properties are also similarly altered in these models ( 26 ). As new treatments are introduced that extend the survival of ALS patients, targeted therapies to prevent skeletal fractures should also be considered, including drugs that inhibit bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates or denosumab, and drugs that promote bone formation, such as teriparatide or abaloparatide."
Longitudinal time course of muscle impairments during partial weight-bearing in rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6706399/,"Abstract In the near future, space agencies plan to send the first crews for extended stays on the Moon and Mars, where gravity is significantly reduced compared to Earth (0.16× g and 0.38× g , respectively). However, the long-term effects of partial gravity have not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts’ health and performance is crucial to the success of these missions. Using a quadrupedal partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the longitudinal time course of muscle function at three different PWB levels. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are correlated to the PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced weight-bearing, emphasizing the need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and successful extraterrestrial exploration.","33 , 34 Thus, it would be interesting to further investigate the metabolic changes that are induced in our model, including skeletal muscle insulin-resistance, mitochondrial respiration and overall energy homeostasis, to determine if these mechanisms, which are known to impact the muscle tissue, contribute to the shift in myofiber type or are a consequence of it. While our behavioral assessments, including food intake, grooming, and physical assessments were helpful and are widely used to identify whether animals are under stress, it will be necessary to sample blood and/or feces at different time points to assess the level of corticosterone for an accurate measurement of the animals’ stress. This model, first developed to investigate the impact of reduced weight-bearing environments observed at extra-terrestrial targets such as the Moon or Mars, additionally brings valuable insights about the potential mitigating effects of applying artificial gravity during spaceflight to preserve muscle health."
The partial weight-bearing rat model using a pelvic harness does not impact stress or hindlimb blood flow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12034070/,"Abstract Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a tool utilized in rehabilitation and injury prevention to improve muscle strength and size, particularly in load-compromised individuals. BFRT facilitates gains in muscular strength and hypertrophy at lower loads, allowing for accelerated recovery and less disuse atrophy. BFRT must be applied appropriately and with caution, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular concerns. There are applications for BFRT across a wide spectrum of human performance training and in rehabilitation of both lower and upper extremity conditions, providing a high-quality adjunct to improve muscle strength, power, and endurance.","BFRT has applications across the continuum of human performance, from immobilization, early rehabilitation with low loads, low-intensity aerobic exercises, as part of a comprehensive strength and conditioning plan, and in recovery. The use of conventional strength training is strongly supported along with the inclusion of BFRT as an adjunct in the otherwise healthy population to optimize mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress to drive muscle growth. It is our role as performance coaches and rehabilitation providers to restore, refine, and prepare the relevant structural and functional qualities of the individual for the task in which they will be participating."
Dose-dependent skeletal deficits due to varied reductions in mechanical loading in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7235020/,"More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks ( n = 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone.","NASA is planning longer duration missions (perhaps up to 3 years) in the next decades, yet we currently have limited data for skeletal responses to spaceflight durations greater than ~6 months, as well as safe and effective countermeasures. While this may suggest that even a slight loading by PWB is sufficient to prevent increased osteoclast activity typically associated with unloading in rodent skeleton, further studies are needed to determine whether the cell and molecular mechanisms governing the response to PWB are similar to those reported for other models of unloading. A recent study demonstrated that disuse-associated skeletal muscle transcriptomic profile in mice differs between cast immobilization vs microgravity in the International Space Station, suggesting that different modes of PWB/unloading may also deteriorate skeleton via distinct mechanisms 33 ."
Approaching Gravity as a Continuum Using the Rat Partial Weight-Bearing Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7599661/,"While spaceflights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and future perspectives in space research and propose potential solutions using the rat PWB model.","In conclusion, the PWB model is a novel experimental method that has extensive potential for the investigation of physiological alterations in response to both micro- and partial gravity. We have thus far been the first group to create and utilize the PWB in rats, both males and females, but anticipate we will not be the last. Regardless, to ensure the safety of astronauts in future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, we need to first understand the complex interactions between human physiology and spaceflight, and the PWB model will play a critical role in unraveling these nuanced relationships."
Hindlimb suspension in Wistar rats: Sex-based differences in muscle response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493566/,"Among them, hindlimb suspension (HLS), developed in 1979 in rats, remains the gold‐standard and allows researchers to study the consequences of total unloading of the hind limbs while inducing a cephalic fluid shift. We exposed 28 adult Wistar rats (14 males and 14 females) to 14 days of HLS or normal loading (NL) to better assess how sex impacts disuse‐induced muscle deconditioning. Females better maintained muscle function during HLS than males, as shown by a more moderate reduction in grip strength at 7 days (males: −37.5 ± 3.1%, females: −22.4 ± 6.5%, compared to baseline), that remains stable during the second week of unloading (males: −53.3 ± 5.7%, females: −22.4 ± 5.5%, compared to day 0) while the males exhibit a steady decrease over time (effect of sex × loading p = 0.0002, effect of sex × time × loading p = 0.0099). Specifically, female rats seem to experience a lesser muscle deconditioning during disuse than males thus emphasizing the need for more studies that will assess male and female animals concomitantly to develop tailored, effective countermeasures for all astronauts.","Based on the previous body of literature, our results could also be linked to substrate usage during force production, which was not explored in our study; since it has been shown that males rely more heavily on glycolytic ATP synthesis than females, which could contribute to the inability to sustain muscle force during submaximal challenges or fatigue protocols (Deschenes et al., 2009 ). Earlier studies performed in humans (Yasuda et al., 2005 ) and rats (Deschenes et al., 2018 ; Il’ina‐Kakueva, 2002 ; Yoshihara et al., 2019 ) have highlighted that disuse leads to similar muscle atrophy in males and females and that the soleus, a weight‐bearing muscle, is highly sensitive to mechanical unloading (Fitts et al., 2000 , 2001 ; Hurst & Fitts, 2003 ; Thomason & Booth, 1990 ). While this may seem surprising due to the strong functional deficits elicited by our 14‐day HLS protocol, previous studies highlighted that gene expression is mostly modulated during the early stages of unloading (Mochalova et al., 2019 ) and often fails to detect significant differences after 14 days of exposure (Atherton et al., 2016 )."

Effects of liquid cultivation on gene expression and phenotype of C. elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6069985/,"Abstract Background Liquid cultures have been commonly used in space, toxicology, and pharmacology studies of Caenorhabditis elegans .

Here, we report the transcriptomic and phenotypic responses of laboratory N2 and the wild-isolate AB1 strains after culturing P 0 worms on agar plates, F 1 in liquid cultures, and F 2 back on agar plates. Conclusions The presented study reveals substantial differences between N2 and AB1 strains for transcriptomic and phenotypical responses to rapid environmental changes.","Earlier studies have identified various classes of ncRNAs and their roles in biological systems including RNA splicing, DNA replication, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and X-chromosome inactivation [ 42 – 46 ]. However, previous studies have determined that the N2 and wild-isolate CB4856 strains display a high variation in gene expressions and many of these strain-specific variations are related to innate immunity genes [ 50 ]. Axenic media is desirable in space, biochemical, and toxicology studies as it enables automated culturing and experimentation, and it eliminates the potential contamination risks due to a bacterial diet [ 6 , 53 , 54 ]."
Transcriptomic Signature of the Simulated Microgravity Response in Caenorhabditis elegans and Comparison to Spaceflight Experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9856674/,"Abstract Given the growing interest in human exploration of space, it is crucial to identify the effects of space conditions on biological processes. Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways.","Moreover, we revealed that the microgravity-responsive genes are potentially conserved between worms and humans by performing function analysis for the human orthologs of the worm microgravity-responsive genes and identifying some of their potential transcriptional regulators. Considering our findings on decreased ceramide levels and the observations on increased telomere in the ISS, investigation of the ceramide and telomere length relationship might prove important to uncover the mechanisms affecting longevity in space. Considering the significantly different gene expression patterns among developmental stages and across cell types [ 76 ], it is possible to retrieve biased results from the averaged gene expression levels."
Enabling clonal analyses of yeast in outer space by encapsulation and desiccation in hollow microparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9410522/,"In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration.","PicoShells compartmentalize single cells in permeable hydrogel capsules to provide additional single-cell analysis tools for exploring cell population heterogeneity, offering the ability to track individual cells and clonal growth over the course of days, for stringing multiple assays together in sequence, and for isolating specific live subpopulations for further study. These abilities improve versatility over other single-cell analysis technologies such as water-in-oil droplets, which cannot easily be exchanged with new reagents or solutions after encapsulation except by techniques such as droplet merging, which require additional microfluidic devices and increased complexity [ 14 ]. However, the PicoShell desiccation method we present here not only improves post-rehydration viability over non-encapsulated yeast, but it preserves particle integrity and yeast health sufficiently well to enable a single-cell analysis that showed cellular heterogeneity in growth behavior and identified highly performing cells."

Dried plum diet protects from bone loss caused by ionizing radiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4750446/,"Abstract Bone loss caused by ionizing radiation is a potential health concern for radiotherapy patients, radiation workers and astronauts. In animal studies, exposure to ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage in skeletal tissues, and results in an imbalance in bone remodeling initiated by increased bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Therefore, we evaluated various candidate interventions with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities (antioxidant cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, dried plum) both for their ability to blunt the expression of resorption-related genes in marrow cells after irradiation with either gamma rays (photons, 2 Gy) or simulated space radiation (protons and heavy ions, 1 Gy) and to prevent bone loss. Dried plum was most effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption ( Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α ) and also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions.","In addition, long duration experiments with DP and ionizing radiation would be valuable to assess whole bone mechanical properties along with structure, as cortical changes develop more slowly due to the lower metabolic activity of cortical tissue compared to cancellous tissue. Nonetheless, the relatively rapid changes (within 11d) in cancellous structure observed due to exposure to ionizing radiation are likely to be biologically relevant as radiation caused the removal of trabecular struts (TbN), which generally is irreversible 3 , 63 , 64 , and DP diet prevented this strut loss. Our studies demonstrated that DP diet supplementation was equally effective at preventing the skeletal responses to both low-LET gamma ( 137 Cs) radiation, at a dose equivalent to a single fraction of radiotherapy, or combined proton and HZE ions, simulating space radiation."
Dietary countermeasure mitigates simulated spaceflight-induced osteopenia in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162976/,"Abstract Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight.","Overall, the ability of DP to protect osteoblast progenitor cells from HU-induced damage, as shown in this study, holds much promise for development of next generation anti-osteoporotic drugs due to the possibility that DP to act on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Our current study is limited to short-duration HU (2 weeks); since astronauts on long-term space missions may require a countermeasure for bone loss throughout the entirety of a multi-year mission beyond LEO, it is important in future studies to determine if DP is protective for long-term exposure to simulated, or actual, spaceflight. Dried plum’s potential as a countermeasure against both radiation- and microgravity-induced osteopenia such as loss of bone strength and structure in the tibia and vertebrae has important implications for astronauts in space as well as radiation workers, radiotherapy patients, and individuals with osteoporosis."
Simulated microgravity alters gene regulation linked to immunity and cardiovascular disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11353732/,"Abstract Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.","In Earth-based cardiovascular disease, altered fluid distribution and pressure changes can give rise to injury of cardiac tissue and therefore may play a role in the upregulated complement response seen in this rodent model for microgravity-induced fluid shifts. Bioinformatic analysis of tissues from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies (e.g., skeletal muscle, adrenals, kidney, liver) consistently show that spaceflight and its analogs lead to altered expression of circadian clock-related genes including Per2 , Arntl , and Clock [ 56 ]. Taken together, the overall transcriptomic signature in the left ventricle of older males at 14 days of HU (~1 human year) suggests activation of the immune system and pro-inflammatory signaling, altered expression of circadian clock genes, and induction of signals that promote ROS production together with upregulation of select cellular defenses to oxidative damage."
Autophagy and its consequences for platelet biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11953390/,"For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway.

A new role of NAP1L1 in megakaryocytes and human platelets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9737020/,"Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34 + -derived megakaryocytes (MKs). PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis.","The presence of transcript variant 5, coding for a protein with a deleted functional domain, could be indicative of alternative protein functions of NAP1L1, besides the nucleosome assembly task in MKs and human PLTs. Taken together, these initial findings focused on NAP1L1 transcripts demonstrated the presence of at least two NAP1L1 transcript variants (1 and 5) and raised the question regarding whether NAP1L1 protein isoforms are located in MK and PLT cell bodies. This finding could be met with surprise since published studies indicate that the PDH complex is inhibited during sepsis, resulting in a switch from mitochondrial aerobic oxidation to cytoplasmic anaerobic glycolysis, a process known to contribute to the formation of lactic acid and intracellular acidosis, which can lead to intracellular Ca2 + overload, mitochondrial membrane damage [ 58 , 82 , 83 ]. These findings contrast our experimental results from septic PLTs. Nevertheless, opposite NAP1L1–PDC-E2 interaction levels, and PDH complex activity could potentially be explained by PLTs being anucleate, and therefore potentially using NAP1L1 protein in a different context than nucleated MKs. In PLTs, it seems more likely that NAP1L1 function could be defined and garnered towards chaperoning PDC-E2."
Evaluation of rodent spaceflight in the NASA animal enclosure module for an extended operational period (up to 35 days),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515519/,"Abstract The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) was developed as a self-contained rodent habitat for shuttle flight missions that provides inhabitants with living space, food, water, ventilation, and lighting, and this study reports whether, after minimal hardware modification, the AEM could support an extended term up to 35 days for Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 female mice for use on the International Space Station. Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study confirmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water.

Morphology of Penicillium rubens Biofilms Formed in Space,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10144393/,"While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens , have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.","If the biofilms have depleted resources by day 15, a decrease in overall biofilm mass, thickness, and surface area can be expected as the cell population will start to die but maintains a minimum population with the assistance of persister cells. The reduced biofilms observed at day 20 could contain these persister cells, which would allow the biofilm to continue growth during a longer incubation time if the environment becomes favorable again, which could present a possible risk for future long-term missions. The results presented in this manuscript can contribute to the efforts of fungal biofilm control in space, but long-term tests (>20 days) as well as complementary transcriptomic and proteomic analyses are highly recommended, as microgravity effects were both material- and incubation-time-dependent."
Explainable machine learning identifies multi-omics signatures of muscle response to spaceflight in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10719374/,"To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space.","Open in a new tab On the technological aspect of this work, we show that one of the major advantages of QLattice compared to traditional multi-omics or differential gene expression analysis methods is its ability to elucidate a variety of mathematical interactions, not necessarily linear, between different multi-omics features. This issue is at least partially addressed by QLattice’s predisposition to limit the architectural complexity of models (which has a strong regularizing effect), as well as its heavy intrinsic feature selection based on mutual information with the target variable. Taken together, our results build on previous work in the field by reporting a promising demonstration of an explainable ML method for space biology research and providing several potential biomarkers for future study on muscle response to spaceflight."
Microbial adaptation to spaceflight is correlated with bacteriophage-encoded functions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11096397/,"Abstract Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism of this adaptation is not understood. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact human health in spaceflight.","Prophages are cited to be the largest factor associated with strain variation and diversity within terrestrial bacterial species 5 , 7 , which holds in the spaceflight environment as phage-associated genes were significantly different in 8 of the 9 phage-containing species analyzed. Increased genetic diversity via Mu-like phage induced mutation may assist in microbial adaptation to the spaceflight environment and would explain the retention of these phage in flight strains. While the discovery of novel prophages is not uncommon, with viral dark matter reported to be 70–95% of human associated viromes 28 , 29 , a previous viral metagenomic study was able to classify the majority of the viruses in extreme environments 30 ."
Influence of the spaceflight environment on macrophage lineages,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166655/,"Macrophages are important immune cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems and participate in immunoregulatory processes of homeostasis. Furthermore, macrophages are critically involved in initiating immunity, defending against injury and infection, and are also involved in immune resolution and wound healing. Heterogeneous populations of macrophage-type cells reside in many tissues and cause a variety of tissue-specific effects through direct or indirect interactions with other physiological systems, including the nervous and endocrine systems. It is vital to understand how macrophages respond to the unique environment of space to safeguard crew members with appropriate countermeasures for future missions in low Earth orbit and beyond.","Future experiments involving combinations of spaceflight stressors, such as elevated CO 2 levels combined with simulated space radiation and gravitational changes, would enable a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of the spaceflight environment on macrophage function. Further investigations of cell- and tissue-specific macrophage responses and phenotypes are also necessary to assess tissue-specific pathologies that connect cellular studies to human disease processes on long-duration missions in deep space. In brief, fundamental studies on macrophages in space have begun to lay the groundwork for the development of targeted countermeasures that optimize macrophage function and are needed to address clinical challenges that arise as space exploration moves beyond low Earth orbit."
MARSBOx: Fungal and bacterial endurance from a balloon-flown analog mission in the stratosphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937622/,"Abstract Whether terrestrial life can withstand the martian environment is of paramount interest for planetary protection measures and space exploration. To understand microbial survival potential in Mars-like conditions, several fungal and bacterial samples were launched in September 2019 on a large NASA scientific balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) where radiation levels resembled values at the equatorial Mars surface. MASE-IM-9 were launched inside the MARSBOx (Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment) payload filled with an artificial martian atmosphere and pressure throughout the mission profile. Our results underscore a wide variation in survival phenotypes of spacecraft associated microorganisms and support the hypothesis that pigmented fungi may be resistant to the martian surface if inadvertently delivered by spacecraft missions.","niger can withstand harsh conditions (e.g., radiation, heat, low water activity, etc.) ( Singaravelan et al., 2008 ; Esbelin et al., 2013 ; Segers et al., 2018 ; Cortesão et al., 2020a ), probably due to the roles of pigmentation, cell wall structure, and metabolic suppression, which might enable them to survive space travel on the outer surfaces of a spacecraft, and to thrive within the spacecraft’s controlled habitat. A more comprehensive radiation biophysics analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo calculations) will be reported later alongside additional balloon flight measurements from a joint NASA-DLR long-duration Antarctic mission flown in December 2019. In the event that these bacteria are brought to Mars, either in robotic missions for astrobiological research purposes; or by accident through crew-led contamination in space missions ( Avila-Herrera et al., 2020 ) our results suggest that bacterial bioburden embedded deep inside of spacecraft sent to Mars might remain viable for longer periods of time (>5 h)."
In situ linkage of fungal and bacterial proliferation to microbiologically influenced corrosion in B20 biodiesel storage tanks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7055474/,"Abstract Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. To measure in situ microbial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and measured in situ corrosion. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae , not yet widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts.","Both Nitrospirillum and Burkholderia have the capacity for nitrogen fixation and thus could be providing the greater microbial community with a source of fixed nitrogen for growth ( Estrada-De Los Santos et al., 2001 ; Chung et al., 2015 ), living in coexistence with the microorganisms responsible for fuel acidification via the production of organic acids that result in corrosion of metallic surfaces within the tanks. Byssochlamys spores can withstand boiling (high temperatures are a part of the biodiesel production process), low concentrations of oxygen that may exist at the bottom of a fuel tank, and pH values as low as 3.5 as microbial community members begin to acidify water at the bottom of a fuel tank ( Tournas, 2008 ). The greatest levels of corrosion observed in the SW tanks correlated with the presence of anaerobic Clostridia and high relative abundances of OTUs most closely related to Byssochlamys , suggesting that corrosion in these tanks was the result of the production of organic acids during the metabolism (either fermentative or aerobic) of FAMEs present within B20."

The real problem is not the absence of observationally well-documented facts about unusual animal behavior but a lack of understanding how the reported non-seismic pre-EQ phenomena are generated in the natural environments, and what are the non-seismic stimuli to which animals appear to respond. The discovery of positive hole charge carriers, h • , has led to insights into the physical processes that occur deep in the Earth crust during the build-up of high levels of stress and into the range of unusual properties that seem to be characteristic of these previously unrecognized electronic charge carriers in rocks [ 28 ]."
The rapid diagnosis and effective inhibition of coronavirus using spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323809/,"Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light–matter interactions. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period.","Next, we determined the selectivity of the naked eye colorimetric assay for the identification of COVID-19 antigen using antibody attached GNPs. Since COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are all coronaviruses, we also performed the same experiment for SARS-CoV virus antigen and MERS-CoV antigen separately using anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles. 2E , we observed the color of the suspension of antibody attached GNPs change from pink to blue, as a result of surface plasmon coupling between antibody attached GNPs. Our reported naked eye colorimetric diagnosis of pseudo SARS-CoV-2 using antibody attached GNPs is very quick and it takes less than 5 minutes to get the results. 3C , very strong SERS signals from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles are observed in the presence of COVID-19 Spike Recombinant Antigen; this is due to the formation of huge amounts of electromagnetic “hotspots”, which enhances Raman intensity by several orders of magnitude via light–matter and matter–matter interactions."
Blocking SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain binding with the ACE2 receptor of the host cell and inhibiting virus infections using human host defense peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8886715/,"Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the ACE2–spike protein binding.","Also, the binding affinities for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are better than only one type of peptide-attached GQDs. The observed higher binding affinity of GQDs conjugated with both the peptides (HNP and LL-37) than GQDs conjugated with a single type of peptide can be due to the presence of multiple binding sites in the spike protein in the case of two peptide-attached GQDs. The reported theoretical modeling indicates that LL37 can bind to the spike-RBD in eight sites (LYS417, GLN493, THR500, ASN501, TYR505, THR500, ASN501, and GLY502). 1 − 6 To understand how the binding affinity between LL-37 & HNP1-attached GQDs and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein RBD of different variants varies, we have determined the effects of RBD mutations on the binding capability with peptide-attached GQDs. As reported in Table 2 , our experimental data indicate that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant spike-RBD is higher than those for the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD. Since the binding affinity for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than only HNP1-attached GQDs, we observed that much higher amounts of GQDs are bound on the virus when both peptides are attached on GQDs. After that, to determine whether HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking the spike protein RBD–ACE2 binding, we have used human embryonic kidney-239T cells with a high expression of ACE2 (HEK-293T)."

Inhibition of Cytomegalovirus by Pentacta pygmaea Fucosylated Chondroitin Sulfate Depends on Its Molecular Weight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10142442/,"Abstract Many viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths.","GAGs have a variety of biological functions, including cell signaling, proliferation, and wound healing, as a result of their structural diversity, and are ubiquitously found on the surface of cells, where they act as receptors and signals for cellular and pathogenic processes [ 36 ]. The virion attachment caused by GAG binding and eventual entry are usually independent events, with attachment assumed to be mostly nonspecific and charge-dependent but, instead, entry is thought to be driven by highly specific protein–protein interactions. In this study, we investigated the anti-HMCV activities of two GAGs: (i) heparin, a highly sulfated linear GAG widely exploited as in research [ 45 ], and (ii) PpFucCS, a unique marine branched GAG."

Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV.","The GCR Simulator Project at NSRL generates an accelerator-based spectrum of energies that closely approximate those that are known to make up the shielded GCR environment in space, thus providing a unique Earthbound system to test CMV reactivation in culture for spaceflight applications. On the contrary, our previous studies showed that gamma rays were more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of lytic gene transcription of EBV. In the current study, viral genomic comparison of pre-radiation, Day 6, Day 12, GCRsim, and proton samples did not reveal significant differences; however, transcriptomic analysis revealed differentially expressed genes when comparing the GCRsim-Day6 cells with mock-exposed cells ( Supplemental Document S2 )."

The time following euthanasia where tissues could be collected and histological integrity was maintained varied with tissue and species ranging between 1 and 3 hours.","For our flight studies, using male and female mice on three different space shuttle flights and the BION M1 flight, it was critical to determine the optimum conditions of tissue harvest and processing for tissues of our interest, namely, testis, epididymis, ovary, and uteri. With regard to obtaining the best possible tissue fixation for histology collected under a multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Program, obtaining many tissues of interest to the participating investigators has to be considered in an integrated way to accommodate the scientific requirements of the overarching flight project, as well as the natural degradation process that tissues undergo as soon as euthanasia has occurred. Finally, with regard to the requirement to ship tissues fixed for histopathology, airline and ground transport providers (especially international carriers) have specific safety regulations that prohibit shipment of samples containing many widely used fixatives and preservatives of tissue histologic integrity."
Effects of sex and gender on adaptations to space: reproductive health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166981/,"Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.","Given that insulin promotes protein synthesis, our finding of decreased expression in soleus of IRS2 (Insulin receptor substrate 2), one of major downstream insulin signaling, suggests that insulin alterations contribute to declines in protein synthesis to promote muscle atrophy in flight; this is also consistent with suggestions from spaceflown C. Overall, postflight up- and down-regulated genes associated with insulin signaling displayed enriched lipid metabolism, hormones (i.e., estrogen, growth hormone, glucagon), circadian rhythm, and immune system pathways. Particular attention should be paid to the effects on reproductive hormone synthesis and actions, as these impact a wide range of tissues, including bone health, energy metabolism and, of course species survival via reproduction."
Effects of spaceflight on the muscles of the murine shoulder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343501/,"Abstract The musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment; this is of particular concern under conditions such as disuse, paralysis, and extended-duration space flight. Although structural and mechanical changes to tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to failure, thereby increasing injury risk. These first observations of the multiscale effects of unloading on the adult enthesis provide new insight into the hierarchical features of structure and composition that endow the enthesis with increased resistance to failure.","The fact that greater tuberosity fractures, compared to other proximal humeral fractures, tend to affect younger individuals [ 55 ] and that multiple clinical reports of these injuries seem to occur in individuals younger than 25 years old [ 53 , 54 ] have led to speculation that bony avulsions are more likely to occur in young patients [ 54 ]. 4.2. Experimental results across hierarchical spatial scales While numerous studies have examined the effects of unloading on tendon and bone [ 1 – 13 , 46 , 47 , 49 , 61 – 63 ], prior to this study, the effects of unloading on the structure and mechanics of the mature adult enthesis across multiple spatial scales were largely unknown. Since extrafibrillar mineral is not constrained within the restrictive volume of the gap zones of the collagen fibrils as is intrafibrillar mineral, the former has a greater range in its possible alignment relative to the fibrils, resulting in a more disordered system."
Multiscale effects of spaceflight on murine tendon and bone,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138367/,"Mice were sent to space on three separate missions: STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 to determine how spaceflight affects the composition, structure, mechanics, and gene expression of the humerus-supraspinatus and calcaneus-Achilles entheses. At the nanoscale, spaceflight resulted in decreased carbonate levels in the bone, likely due to increased remodeling, as suggested by increased expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis ( CatK , Tnfsf11) and mature osteoblasts ( Col1 , Osc) . Tendons showed a shift in collagen fibril size towards smaller diameters that may have resulted from increased expression of genes related to collagen degradation ( Mmp3, Mmp13) . This lack of tissue-level change may be anatomy based, as extremities may be less sensitive to spaceflight than central locations such as vertebrae, yet results highlight that the tendon enthesis may be robust against negative effects of spaceflight.","These results demonstrate that the tendon enthesis is relatively robust to spaceflight conditions, although longer durations of spaceflight may result in structural and mechanical changes driven by the observed early nanoscale and gene expression effects. Such an increase in expression of mature ostoblast genes has not been previously reported with unloading; osteoblast activity in unloaded conditions is usually limited by increased apoptosis and a shift towards adipose MSC differentiation ( 28 – 30 ). Even with measurable decreases in the tendon cross-sectional area (in agreement with ( 43 )), the stiffness and maximum force of the entheses were unaffected, suggesting that the rotator cuff and Achilles tendon-to-bone attachments were able to carry matching loads before and after 2 or 4 weeks of spaceflight."
Reproducible changes in the gut microbiome suggest a shift in microbial and host metabolism during spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6689164/,"While previous findings have demonstrated a change in the gut microbial community structure during spaceflight, specific environmental factors that alter the gut microbiome and the functional relevance of the microbiome changes during spaceflight remain elusive. Using STARMAPs, we found the observed microbiome changes shared similarity with data reported in mice flown in a previous space shuttle mission, suggesting reproducibility of the effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiome. Finally, we identified host genes whose expression in the liver were concordantly altered with the inferred gut microbial gene content, particularly highlighting a relationship between host genes involved in protein metabolism and microbial genes involved in putrescine degradation. Our findings represent a key step toward a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian health during spaceflight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew health during long-term human space expeditions.","More importantly, using a newly developed statistical tool, STARMAPs, we tested the similarity in spaceflight-associated microbiome changes between RR-1 mice and mice onboard a previous shuttle mission STS-135 in a formal statistical setting, and we found that spaceflight-associated microbiome changes in the two missions were similar, despite the differences between the two missions in the durations of spaceflight, animal study protocol, as well as microbiome profiling and data processing methods. Although the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation cannot be dissected experimentally using the current rodent research mission hardware, our study also presents a step toward an understanding of their contributions to the changes in the gut microbiome during spaceflight using statistical analysis with STARMAPs. Our analysis showed a lack of similarity between spaceflight-associated microbiome changes and those induced by exposures to space-type radiation on the ground. Given the differences in experimental conditions between Flight and Ground groups discussed above, we hypothesize that spaceflight-associated microbiome changes can be largely attributed to microgravity, which may influence microbial physiology and growth via low fluid shear dynamics [ 19 , 20 ] and host physiological responses including altered digesta propulsion and digestive function [ 21 ], inflammation [ 22 ], fluid shift, and cardiovascular functions [ 23 ]."
Failure to Generate Bone Marrow Adipocytes Does Not Protect Mice from Ovariectomy-Induced Osteopenia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564669/,"Abstract A reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported in ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a negative effect on bone growth and turnover balance. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kit W/W-v mice. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the in kit W/W-v mice. However, ovx in WT and kit W/W-v mice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters.","Similar ovx-induced changes in bone mass, architecture, and indices of bone turnover following ovx were observed in kit W/W-v mice in spite of absence of bone marrow adipocytes and an attenuated increase in total body fat mass. Interestingly, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting kit signaling have been reported to reduce blood glucose levels in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and decrease body weight in rodents fed a high fat diet [ 48 , 49 ]. The lower cancellous bone volume in the proximal tibial metaphysis of 14-week-old mice was associated with increases in osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters, suggesting that kit signaling in mice also functions to regulate bone balance in adults."
Acute exposure to high dose gamma-radiation results in transient activation of bone lining cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4042434/,"Increased trabecular thickness and separation and reduced fractional cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number were detected in proximal tibia and lumbar vertebra 14 days following γ-irradiation with 6 Gy. To establish the cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14 days following irradiation. There was a strong association between radiation-induced marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype (Pearson correlation −0.85, p<0.0001). A priming dose of γ-radiation (0.5 mGy), previously shown to reduce mortality, had minimal effect on the cellular responses to radiation and did not prevent detrimental changes in bone architecture. In summary, radiation-induced death of marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter.","Osteoblast-lined bone perimeter was not reported in the Green and colleagues study [ 10 ] and the fluorochrome labeling protocol used to calculate bone formation at later time points may have resulted in excessive label escape error, potentially compromising interpretation of dynamic bone measurements [ 28 ]. Whereas coupled bone remodeling would tend to preserve bone architecture, the absence of coupling between bone resorption and bone formation observed in this study acts to accentuate changes in bone architecture (increased trabecular thickness and reduced trabecular number) in irradiated mice because the increases in bone formation and resorption are occurring at discrete sites. Thus, a rapid restoration of bone marrow cell populations may be critical because relatively long duration studies failed to show skeletal recovery in mice exposed to high but sub-lethal doses of ionizing radiation [ 9 , 10 ]."
Morbid obesity attenuates the skeletal abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161659/,"In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum ( ob/ob ) , and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob ). Cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower in ob/ob compared to WT mice; reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. Similarly, femoral length, BMC, and cortical thickness were lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice, as were indices of cancellous bone formation and resorption. In contrast, bone marrow adiposity, calcified cartilage and cancellous bone volume fraction were higher at one or more cancellous sites in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice.","The higher cancellous bone volume fraction was associated with (1) greatly reduced serum CTx levels, (2) reductions in mRNA levels for NFKB, Itgam and Icam1, (3) retention of calcified cartilage, and (4) retention of fluorochrome label administered at study initiation, all indicative of a defect in bone resorption. In contrast to peripheral fat depots, which act as dynamic energy reservoirs to maintain circulating triglyceride and free fatty acid levels during feeding and fasting, marrow fat increases with severe weight loss as well as weight gain ( Bredella, et al. In rats, treatment with parathyroid hormone (whose actions on bone are largely mediated through IGF1) prevented the increase in bone marrow adiposity associated with severe energy restriction ( Turner and Iwaniec 2011 ), whereas growth hormone treatment dramatically reduced excessive bone marrow adiposity in severely hypoleptinemic hypophysectomized rats ( Menagh et al."
Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reduces body weight without accelerating age-related bone loss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4917201/,"Unfortunately, dieting, exercise, and pharmacological interventions have had limited long-term success in weight control and can result in detrimental side effects, including accelerating age-related cancellous bone loss. We investigated the efficacy of using hypothalamic leptin gene therapy as an alternative method for reducing weight in skeletally-mature (9-month-old) female rats and determined the impact of leptin-induced weight loss on bone mass, density, and microarchitecture, and serum biomarkers of bone turnover (CTx and osteocalcin). Rats were implanted with cannulae in the 3rd ventricle of the hypothalamus and injected with either recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding the gene for rat leptin (rAAV-Leptin, n=7) or a control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP, n=10) and sacrificed 18 weeks later. In summary, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats maintained a lower body weight compared to baseline and rAAV-GFP-treated rats with minimal effects on bone mass, density, microarchitecture, or biochemical markers of bone turnover.","In contrast to the notable effects of leptin to increase bone formation in leptin-deficient mice, increased leptin levels associated with moderate weight gain had no effect on bone metabolism in skeletally mature rats ( Turner and Iwaniec 2010 ). The lack of an effect of rAAV-Leptin gene therapy on bone in skeletally mature rats contrasts with the negative skeletal effects associated with similar weight loss induced by caloric restriction ( Turner and Iwaniec 2011 ). Our findings suggest that interventions, including hypothalamic leptin gene therapy, targeted toward increasing hypothalamic leptin levels have the potential to overcome leptin resistance and lower body weight without negatively impacting the skeleton."
Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy Reduces Bone Marrow Adiposity in ob/ob Mice Fed Regular and High-Fat Diets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4985531/,"Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets; ob/ob mice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet.","Additionally, long-duration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy was shown to normalize bone microarchitecture in ob/ob mice; specifically, increasing hypothalamic leptin levels resulted in increased femur length and total femur bone volume but decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra ( 28 ). Thus, an imbalance between bone formation and resorption related to local environment (e.g., precursor cell populations, mechanical loads, paracrine factors, etc.) potentially explains the contrasting phenotypes that have been identified in bones of the limb and spine in ob/ob mice ( 41 ). Evidence that factors secondary to leptin deficiency are responsible for the discrepancy, as suggested by Yue et al., are presently lacking and correction of many of the metabolic abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency (e.g., hyperglycemia), rather than improving, actually worsens the skeletal phenotype of ob/ob mice ( 18 )."
Room temperature housing results in premature cancellous bone loss in growing female mice: implications for the mouse as a preclinical model for age-related bone loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421618/,"Abstract Purpose Female mice are often used as preclinical models for osteoporosis but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss during growth. The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether housing female mice at thermoneutral (temperature range where the basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss) alters bone growth, turnover and microarchitecture. Results C57BL/6J mice housed at 22°C experienced a 62% cancellous bone loss from the distal femur metaphysis during the interval from 8–18 weeks of age and lesser bone loss from the distal femur epiphysis, whereas cancellous and cortical bone mass in 32°C-housed mice were unchanged or increased. The beneficial effects of thermoneutral housing on cancellous bone were associated with decreased Ucp1 gene expression in brown adipose tissue, increased bone marrow adiposity, higher rates of bone formation, higher expression levels of osteogenic genes and locally decreased bone resorption.","Standard laboratory animal housing temperatures (18–23°C) are within the thermoneutral comfort range of the staff but subject mice to temperatures well below the thermoneutral zone for this species (26–34°C range; ~32°C for B6 strain) and has profound effects on energy allocation, including activation of UCP1 in BAT to generate heat (adaptive thermogenesis) in the active nighttime fed state and reduction in core temperature, including bouts of torpor, during short-term fasting (e.g., sleep) and/or food restriction (e.g., pair feeding). These findings do not preclude an important role for diurnal changes in sympathetic outflow in mediating the negative skeletal effects of mild cold stress but rather suggest additional factors may contribute to the observed response. These changes were associated with altered gene expression of hormone receptors ( Vdr, Fgfr1, Fgfr2, Bmpr1a, Lrp5 ), growth factors (multiple Bmps, Tgfb1, Dkk1, Sost, Tnf, Tnfsf11, Vegfa, Vegfb ), cell signaling ( Smad1, 2, 3 ) and transcription factors ( Jun, Sox9 ) involved in FGF, BMP, and Wnt signaling."
Spaceflight-induced vertebral bone loss in ovariectomized rats is associated with increased bone marrow adiposity and no change in bone formation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515514/,"Abstract There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae ( n =11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation.","25 Reproductive changes during or post flight have not been systematically studied in women, but in female adult mice spaceflight induced cessation of cycling, loss of corpora lutea, and reduced estrogen receptor mRNA levels in the uterus. 8 , 27–29 Although no spaceflight experiments comparing gender have been conducted, direct comparison of the skeletal response of normal male and female rats approaching skeletal maturity (6 months old) to hindlimb unloading did not detect gender differences. 21 In summary, we conclude that the increase in MAT during short-duration spaceflight does not impair osteoblast activity, reduce the interval osteoblasts are present on bone surfaces or decrease generation of new osteoblasts."
Role of oestrogen receptor signaling in skeletal response to leptin in female ob/ob mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8671758/,"In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice ( p < 0.01). However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work.","In the present study, we confirmed that leptin deficiency induced a shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length in the post-pubertal (12-week old) ob/ob mice compared with WT mice, which suggested that the absence of leptin may be the primary factor for the contrasting growth pattern between limb and spine during the whole life of ob/ob female mice. ERs mediated cellular response of estrogen, and previous studies using different global ER knock-out mouse models have suggested that ERα and ERβ presented opposing effects on longitudinal bone growth in female mice ( 20 , 22 , 39 ). Taken together, our results show that leptin deficiency directly induced the different expression patterns of ERα at femoral and vertebral GP and low serum estradiol level in ob/ob mice during puberty, and the regulative effects of ER antagonists were disturbed by the absence of leptin."
Effects of hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on osteopetrosis in leptin-deficient mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771473/,"Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.","Lack of differences between rAAV-Lep and rAAV-GFP-treated mice provides strong evidence that increased leptin levels and not differences arising from the application of gene therapy were responsible for the skeletal changes observed. Hypertrophic chondrocytes contribute to programed removal of cartilage matrix by secretion of factors such as TNFSF11 (RANKL), MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), MMP13 (collagenase 3), and HMGB1 (high-mobility group protein 1) that mediate vascular invasion and are altered by leptin status ( Koskinen, et al. Our findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is site-specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover."
Leptin stimulates bone formation in ob/ob mice at doses having minimal impact on energy metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288125/,"Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC 50 infusion rates of 7–17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC 50 , 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone’s CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions.","The authors concluded that icv leptin achieves exposure levels in the brain at least 300 times higher than when delivered iv, but efficient reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid into the blood introduces leptin into peripheral circulation where the hormone can bind to receptors on target cells. Thus, the exquisite sensitivity of bone to low blood levels of leptin reported in the current study combined with the knowledge that leptin is transported out of the brain into peripheral circulation following icv infusion question whether the skeletal response to icv leptin is entirely due to actions mediated centrally. The saturable transport system, which limits delivery of leptin from the hormone’s origin in peripheral adipose tissue to the hypothalamus, may function to guarantee that adequate energy is available for important anabolic processes such as bone growth and turnover and that these actions are dissociable from the actions of the hormone to reduce appetite and increase thermogenesis."
Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue Deficiency Increases Disuse-Induced Bone Loss in Male Mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5389344/,"We used MAT-deficient Kit W/W−v (MAT-) mice to determine if absence of MAT reduced bone loss in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice. Male MAT- and wild-type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to a baseline, control or HU group (n = 10 mice/group) within each genotype and HU groups unloaded for 2 weeks. HU MAT- mice had elevated cancellous bone formation and resorption compared to other treatment groups as well as a unique profile of differentially expressed genes. In summary, results from this study suggest that MAT deficiency was not protective, and was associated with exaggerated disuse-induced cancellous bone loss.","Compared to cancellous bone in the metaphysis, which is highly sensitive to systemic factors that regulate mineral homeostasis (e.g., gonadal hormones), cancellous bone in the epiphysis experiences higher strain energy levels during weight bearing, suggesting a more important mechanical role, and exhibits lower bone loss in response to gonadectomy or aging 37 , 38 , 39 . This suggests that MAT- mice have an impaired ability to regulate blood glucose levels which may be relevant to their excessive bone loss compared to WT mice as the skeletal response to mechanical loading is impaired in mice with hyperglycemia 54 . Also notable following HU was the genotype-specific (MAT- only) differential expression of genes related to fatty acid metabolism (Alox5, Alox10 and Alox12) and cytokine, neurotransmitter and hormone signaling (Comt, Hsd11b, Esr1, Igfbp2, Il6, Il6ra, Lta, Nos3, NPY, Nr3c1, Shbg, and Tshr)."
Metabolic Coupling Between Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue and Hematopoiesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9784906/,"Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. After HFD feeding, Mrc1 −/− mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1 −/− mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development.","This pro-inflammatory hematopoiesis not only aggravates the dysmetabolic condition but also stands as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [ 28 ], calling for an investigation of the molecular mechanisms driving this effect. Intriguingly, the soluble mannose receptor has been shown to stimulate tissue macrophage activation towards inflammation, and its deficiency in mice fed an HFD resulted in reduced tissue inflammation and a better metabolic phenotype [ 25 ]. Highly active myelopoiesis observed in dysmetabolic conditions is commonly associated with a systemic immune activation characterized by the increased frequency of blood inflammatory cells and circulating markers of inflammation [ 29 ]."
Maintenance of near normal bone mass and architecture in lethally irradiated female mice following adoptive transfer with as few as 750 purified hematopoietic stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6548323/,Abstract Total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by transfer of bone marrow cells from donors is routinely performed in immunology research and can be used to manipulate differentiation and/or function of bone cells. The goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without negatively affecting bone metabolism. In vivo analysis and in vitro differentiation assays performed two months later established that both methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with donor-derived cells. Minimal differences were observed between controls and WBB6F1-engrafted mice that received fractionated doses of 2 × 5 Gy. Kit w/wv mice lost weight and became osteopenic after 2 × 5 Gy irradiations but these abnormalities were negligible after 5 Gy irradiation.,"Here we show that bone marrow was reconstituted in female mice after lethal TBI when the mice were engrafted with unsorted bone marrow cells or purified HSCs. Both methods of adoptive transfer were effective in reconstituting osteoclast precursors from donor cells but neither method successfully reconstituted bone marrow adipocyte precursors from donor cells and neither method prevented radiation-associated suppression of linear bone growth or reduction in bone volume. The differentiation studies performed here confirm successful reconstitution of donor-derived osteoclast precursors after engraftment with unsorted bone marrow cells or purified HSCs. At the gene level, there were only minor differences between control mice and mice receiving purified HSCs (WBB6F1 HSC → WBB6F1) in expression levels of more than 300 genes in tibia related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function, adipogenesis and hematopoie-sis. It would be difficult to interpret the results of an experiment in which radiation was delivered without follow-up treatment because bone metabolism is strongly influenced by nutritional status, and the initial indicator symptoms of ARS include reduced appetite and weight loss."
Effect of leptin deficiency on the skeletal response to hindlimb unloading in adult male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6597714/,"Abstract Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have less bone than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to weight bearing. ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. In summary, leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU-induced osteopenia in male mice, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting.","Thus, high levels of MAT in mice could theoretically diminish the skeletal response to mechanical loading by at least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, impairment of osteoblast differentiation and stimulation of osteoclast activity. HU was originally designed as an earth-based model for microgravity 68 and chosen for the current study because (1) it is minimally invasive (i.e., does not require surgery), (2) prevents weight bearing, but unlike limb casting does not prohibit voluntary muscle loading, and (3) in contrast to unilateral sciatic neurotomy, does not directly influence neuronal regulation of bone metabolism. In summary, chronic leptin deficiency in male ob/ob mice resulted in shorter femora, lower femoral bone mass and density, alterations in cortical bone microarchitecture, site- and bone-specific alterations in cancellous bone architecture, and greatly increased MAT levels."
Thermoneutral housing attenuates premature cancellous bone loss in male C57BL/6J mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6865368/,"Abstract Mice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal maturity. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism.","Bone, particularly periosteum ( 13 ), is highly innervated by efferent sympathetic nerves and it is well documented that catecholaminergic signaling pathways in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells modulate the functional activity and differentiation fate of these cells; in general, increased catecholaminergic activity inhibits osteoblast function and enhances osteoclast function ( 22 ). Bone mass is determined by the balance of bone formation and bone resorption, and the findings herein suggest the bone-protective effects of 32°C housing on cancellous bone volume in distal femur metaphysis may involve maintenance of osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast activity, whereas mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing results in depressed osteoblastogenesis. A limitation to using whole bone is that bone marrow is composed of a heterogeneous cell population, and therefore, we cannot attribute lipid species to specific cell types or regions (e.g., proximal, midshaft, distal); additionally, our methodology does not allow us to distinguish between lipid classes (e.g., non-esterified fatty acids, glycerolipids, sphingolipids, ether lipids, or waxes)."
Effects of Spaceflight on Cancellous and Cortical Bone in Proximal Femur in Growing Rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7907224/,"We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. In ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. In summary, findings from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats.","The dramatically lower cancellous bone volume fraction noted in the femoral head of rats flown aboard STS-41 was a surprise ( Turner et al., 2019 ) because histomorphometric evaluation and gene expression analyses failed to detect spaceflight-induced changes in other regions of the skeleton following this 4-day mission ( Backup et al., 1994 ; Turner, 1995 ; Turner et al., 1995 ). Based on absence of reduction in longitudinal bone growth, absence of reduction in mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins, and absence of histomorphometric evidence for decreased bone formation at multiple skeletal sites assessed, the most likely explanation for the dramatic osteopenia in femoral head in rats from STS-41 is increased bone resorption ( Backup et al., 1994 ; Turner, 1995 ; Turner et al., 1995 ). Compared to ground-based flight controls, flight animals had lower cancellous bone volume fraction in femur at all sites evaluated (head, distal metaphysis and distal epiphysis) but showed no change in cortical thickness (proximal femur and mid-diaphysis)."
Evidence for increased thermogenesis in female C57BL/6J mice housed aboard the international space station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213760/,"Abstract Sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed aboard the International Space Station after 37 days of flight (RR-1 mission) and frozen carcasses returned to Earth. RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT). Spaceflight resulted in differential expression of genes in BAT consistent with increased non-shivering thermogenesis and differential expression of genes in WAT consistent with increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and β-oxidation.

Leptin and environmental temperature as determinants of bone marrow adiposity in female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9582271/,"Abstract Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C) than in mice housed at 22°C, as are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib group, changes not replicated by pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. However, infusion of ob/ob mice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT.","Taken together, factors such as ckit signaling, mechanical loading, leptin status, sex hormones and aging clearly influence BMAT levels but strong evidence that BMAT is an obligatory regulator of bone turnover balance is largely absent. In the present study, leptin and pair feeding influenced expression of genes for adipokines (Lep), hormones and growth factors (Fgf2, Fgf10, Agt, Angpt2, Bmp2, Bmp7, Dlk1), cell cycle regulators (Ccnd1, Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b), nuclear hormone receptors (Ppard, Pparg), transcription factors (Jun, Nrob2, Twist1, E2f1, Hes1, Srebf1), and signaling pathways (Sfrp1, Sfrp5, Vdr, Wnt10b, Dkk1, Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Kfl2, Insr, Irs1). In the present study, performed at thermoneutral, leptin supplementation, but not pair feeding, increased expression of genes important to fat synthesis and turnover in WAT; Acacb (Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase), Adig (adipogenin), Retn (resistin), Slc2a4 (facilitated glucose transporter member 4, GLUT4), and Srebf1 (Sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1)."
Small changes in thermoregulation influence cancellous bone turnover balance in distal femur metaphysis in growing female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10063413/,"When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment. This study aimed to determine how small differences in temperature (4 °C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) single housed at 22 °C, 3) single housed at 26 °C, or 4) group housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis.","This possibility is supported by our finding that female mice housed aboard the International Space Station (ISS) had increased expression of Ucp1 in BAT compared to ground-based control mice, in spite of comparable housing temperatures ( Wong et al., 2021 ). The response of bones of the lower limb, such as the femur, to differences in thermogenesis is of particular interest for microgravity research because spaceflight simulation studies using ground-based models such as hindlimb unloading typically focus on the response of weight-bearing bone to unloading ( Grimm et al., 2016 ). Finally, single housed mice may experience additional stress due to social isolation ( Liu et al., 2020 ) and we cannot rule out the possibility that the attenuation of bone loss observed among the group housed mice may also be due, in part, to reduced stress independent of temperature."
Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue Is Not Required for Reconstitution of the Immune System Following Irradiation in Male Mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10889206/,"Abstract Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is hypothesized to serve as an expandable/contractible fat depot which functions, in part, to minimize energy requirements for sustaining optimal hematopoiesis. The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.","The Sl mutation in Kit Sl/Sld mice deletes the entire Sl (kit ligand) gene whereas the Steel-Dickie ( Sl d ) mutation, resulting from an intragenic 4-kb deletion, removes sequences encoding transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, limiting expression of the gene to produce only a soluble form of kit ligand [ 35 ]. There is strong in vitro evidence that adipocytes support the long-term survival of hematopoietic lineage cells via kit signaling [ 36 ] and a recent study concluded that lipolysis from BMAT is required to fuel bone cells and the marrow niche following energy deficits or injury [ 21 ]. We also demonstrated that inhibition of kit signaling with the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gleevec rapidly reduced marrow adipocyte area and density in rats, suggesting that maintenance of mature adipocytes in bone marrow requires kit signaling [ 29 ]."
Simulated Microgravity Promotes Horizontal Gene Transfer of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes between Bacterial Genera in the Absence of Antibiotic Selective Pressure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468678/,"This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions.

Two AMR genes, bla OXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter pittii, were tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. Keywords: horizontal gene transfer, simulated microgravity, high aspect ratio vessel (HARV), antimicrobial resistance, space environment, Staphylococcus aureus , Acinetobacter pittii","In addition, even if astronauts are screened for problematic microbes prior to flight, issues could still arise, as commensals are known to act as reservoirs for AMR genes that can be disseminated to (opportunistic) pathogens [ 22 , 23 , 24 ]. It was beyond the scope of the study to determine the cause of the increased HGT that was observed, but one mechanism could be increased competence, allowing for transformation to occur, one of three modes of gene transfer. aureus is not classically considered to be naturally competent, as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis are, it does harbor genes that are involved in competence and thought to promote natural competence under the right conditions [ 30 , 31 ]."
Understanding the Complexities and Changes of the Astronaut Microbiome for Successful Long-Duration Space Missions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9031868/,"Abstract During space missions, astronauts are faced with a variety of challenges that are unique to spaceflight and that have been known to cause physiological changes in humans over a period of time. Several of these changes occur at the microbiome level, a complex ensemble of microbial communities residing in various anatomic sites of the human body, with a pivotal role in regulating the health and behavior of the host. For these reasons, understanding the impact of spaceflight and space conditions on the microbiome of astronauts is important to assess significant health risks that can emerge during long-term missions and to develop countermeasures. Here, we review various conditions that are caused by long-term space exploration and discuss the role of the microbiome in promoting or ameliorating these conditions, as well as space-related factors that impact microbiome composition.","Moreover, we have examined less well-established links between spaceflight, bone loss and the microbiome and emphasized the importance of taking into account gender differences when designing appropriate countermeasures for short- and long-term missions. As we move forward with long-term space travel and human habitation beyond LEO, more studies will be needed that explore the astronaut microbiome, the factors governing its stability or disruption and its interaction with the host and the spacecraft environment. We hope that the literature presented in this review and the recommendations provided will help in future study design, technology and product development, and policies that center around the human microbiome, as we propel human exploration beyond anything we have seen so far."
Toward sustainable space exploration: a roadmap for harnessing the power of microorganisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10030976/,"Abstract Finding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration.

Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.","It has been discussed how microbial biotechnologies may support several processes that, in turn, can help decrease supply chain dependency (from Earth) on long-duration deep-space exploration missions to eventually enable human footholds and settlements across the solar system. Augmenting existing space-based facilities to increase the capacity for space experiments, in terms of sample replicates and experimental conditions, should also be considered to improve the impact of the preliminary studies. Finally, the potential of these technologies for terrestrial benefits has been discussed, with specific reference to the United Nation SDGs. If ultra-efficient approaches to sustaining human life and economic activity off-Earth can be adapted towards meaningfully solving problems on our planet, space exploration will have yielded a manifold return on public investments and will thereby become more sustainable not only technologically, but also politically."
Roll maneuvers are essential for active reorientation of Caenorhabditis elegans in 3D media,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5910807/,"Significance Investigations of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans give powerful insights into fundamental biological processes that are conserved across species.

Our results provide important insights into 3D neuromuscular actuation and may be used to develop better assays for locomotion phenotype analysis.","For nematodes swimming in a shear-thinning suspension ( 51 ), a moderate increase in the head-bending angle was observed, but even in this case, the overall form of undulations remained similar to the waveform observed in Newtonian fluids. We find that the torsional wave propagating throughout the entire body length can produce a 90° roll in less than one undulation period, consistent with rolls observed in our laboratory experiments using wild-type C. elegans may have a high degree of functional complexity, we conjecture that 3D proprioception may give rise to asymmetric neural signals and differential muscular contractions that are needed to achieve well-controlled out-of-plane body movements during the torsional roll."
Microfluidic Device for Studying Nematodes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12021249/,"Abstract The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been routinely used to study gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices.","We tested three different concentrations of bleach solution (10%, 20%, and 25% in M9 buffer) with varying exposure times (30, 60, 120, and 150 seconds) to identify the optimal condition that killed the larvae (identified by lack of movement) with minimal impact on embryos. Embryos obtained by filtration develop comparably to the embryos obtained by bleach synchronization We aimed to understand differences in the development of G 1 embryos collected by bleach and filtration protocols, so we harvested embryos using bleach synchronization and filtration protocols in parallel and measured the lengths of the animals after 48 hours of growth using a liquid-based larval development assay [ 3 , 5 , 22 , 23 ]. For all six strains, the normalized animal lengths for larvae that developed from G 1 embryos collected by filtration were similar or significantly longer to the normalized animal lengths for larvae that developed from G 1 embryos recovered by bleach synchronization for both the control (DMSO exposed) and albendazole-exposed conditions ( Fig 7 )."

Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.","Frequent exertion of maximal forces in A3 arena can be understood from the high mechanical resistance to locomotion provided by this tight pillar arena where the nematode muscles push against the pillar, but its body cannot adjust its position in response to reaction forces due to the body being constrained simultaneously by multiple pillars.

"Swim exercise in Caenorhabditis elegans extends neuromuscular and gut healthspan, enhances learning ability, and protects against neurodegeneration",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6876156/,"Significance Exercise is a powerful antiaging intervention that protects against cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, sarcopenia, and cancer. We establish a young adult swim exercise regimen for the short-lived nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that induces health benefits at the neuromuscular, intestinal, and cognitive levels and protects against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Importantly, we found that swim exercise performed exclusively in early adulthood promotes long-lasting systemic benefits that are still detectable in midlife. elegans as a short-lived genetic model will allow for dissection of the molecular circuitry involved in system-wide exercise benefits.","Particularly noteworthy is that we find benefits of exercise regimens in young adult life that can be documented to extend late into life after the regular exercise period ends, a finding that suggests a potential switch mechanism for healthy aging trajectories might be triggered by even limited early enhanced activity. It is important to note that in our studies, this time-window occurs 8 to 16 d after the last exercise session, raising the possibility that extension of the swim regimen beyond the first 4 d of adulthood may further potentiate survival differences and underscoring that early adult activity can have long lasting impact on healthy aging. In humans, exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease ( 52 ), although high-intensity, prolonged exercise sessions will cause an acute increase in intestinal permeability (or “leaky gut”) ( 53 ), which has been associated with infectious diseases, obesity, and autoimmune diseases ( 54 )."
Molecular muscle experiment: Hardware and operational lessons for future astrobiology space experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415877/,"Abstract Biology experiments in space seek to increase our understanding of what happens to life beyond Earth and how we can safely send life beyond Earth.

The use of CeMM rather than OP50 as a food source may therefore reduce the oxygen exchange requirement and thus increase the viability of worm experiments conducted inside plastic culture bags on the ISS, but this comes with the added challenge that CeMM is more prone to become contaminated. elegans culture and ISS will be limited principally by the exchange properties of the culture bags and not the ECs. The second most challenging portion of our preflight testing was testing and finalizing suitable scenarios for upload to the ISS that were consistent both with current operational realities and with successfully conducting our experiment."
Tart Cherry Increases Lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by Altering Metabolic Signaling Pathways,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7285199/,"The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals.

We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. This HA tag results in normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional uptake.","In this study, we explored the biophysical properties and in vivo function of an example of ~600 aa sequence that has similar features (low sequence complexity, lack of predicted domains and minimal levels of predicted secondary structure elements) and location between two protein kinase domains in the UNC-89/obscurin class of giant muscle proteins. Sarcomere assembly is known to occur from the outside inwards, first with the deposition of ECM proteins like perlecan, followed by localization of integrins, and then localization of integrin adhesion proteins (UNC-112 (kindlin), PAT-4 (ILK), UNC-97 (PINCH), PAT-6 (α-parvin), followed by assembly of M-line or dense body (Z-disk)-specific proteins [ 40 , 41 ]. We designed this for future immunoprecipitation experiments to further test whether UNC-89 interacting partners that we have discovered primarily through two hybrid screens are actually associated with UNC-89: we would create in-frame deletions of segments of UNC-89 that are suspected to bind to a partner, then IP those internally deleted UNC-89 proteins, and look for absence of the association."
NemaLife chip: a micropillar-based microfluidic culture device optimized for aging studies in crawling C. elegans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7530743/,"Abstract In this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the scoring of animal survival and health measures.

Mitochondrial sulfide promotes life span and health span through distinct mechanisms in developing versus adult treated Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410709/,"We show that small, clinically meaningful doses of a mitochondrion-targeting sulfur donor (AP39) extend Caenorhabditis elegans health in older age, which act by maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Adult onset of AP39 delivery, when mitochondrial and cell structural dysfunction are already manifested, also promoted healthy aging. Distinct association of health span extension with mitochondria, cytoskeletal and peroxisome molecular profiles, under regulation of the elt-6 / elt-3 transcription factor regulatory circuit, further distinguished adult-onset AP39 therapy. Our results establish a framework for forward translating mitochondrial sulfide as a potentially viable healthy aging intervention in mammals.","Adult mtH 2 S treatments also increase health span, predominantly in later life, and associates with rejuvenation of key features of the aging transciptome, including mitochondrial function, cytoskeletal content, and peroxisomal metabolism, which appear to be controlled by a GATA transcription factor circuit. Additionally, the lack of mechanistic regulation of health span by the Nrf2 antioxidant system implies that improved peroxisome fatty acid oxidation, as opposed to lowered reactive oxygen species generation, underpin peroxisomal effects of mtH 2 S on healthy aging. Previous work established age-related elt-6 upregulation and downstream repression of elt-3 , which accounted for altered expression of ~1,300 “aging” genes ( 54 ), which might comprise an evolutionarily conserved element of natural aging adaptation that promotes longevity, perhaps at the expense of health span, similarly to FoxO."
Bisphosphonates attenuate age-related muscle decline in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10751425/,"Abstract Background Age‐related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Methods Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. Conclusions Despite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life course.","While general stress response pathways, such as FOXO, regulate these positive healthspan responses to ZA, we establish muscle‐centric myokines ( agxt‐2 and igdb‐1 ) and mitochondrial sirtuin ( sir‐2.3 ) as previously unknown regulators of bisphosphonate effects on ageing muscle health. Mitochondrial health is strongly linked with sarcopenic progression across species and mitochondrial structure corresponds with oxidative function 23 ; therefore, bisphosphonates might hold dual, and possibly interrelated, efficacy for maintaining muscle metabolic health and sarcomeric integrity. 36 Our data suggest that sarcopenia can be added to this list, whereby knockdown of a key enzyme in mevalonate metabolism, farnesyl diphosphate synthetase ( fdps‐1 ), allows normal larval development to adulthood and young adult (day 1) movement rates, corroborating earlier reports of normal L4 larvae muscle architecture upon fdps‐1 RNAi. 37 Thereafter, downregulation of fdps‐1 causes rapid neuromuscular functional decline (i.e., animal motility), likely indicative of accelerated sarcopenia."
Spaceflight Induces Strength Decline in Caenorhabditis elegans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10605753/,"Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of space biology, combined with ‘NemaFlex-S’ microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors.","This experiment presents an example of how near-simultaneous in-flight collection of -omics alongside phenotypic measures can enable insights into the potential molecular mechanisms behind spaceflight-associated physiological deconditioning [ 120 ]. At the simplest level, DEG analysis focuses on individual genes, while this may be useful, it ignores the power of big data, such as reproducibility [ 123 ] across experiments and systems and may be biased based upon differences in computational approach/pipeline [ 124 ]. Further, our new analysis reveals that calcium metabolism in neurons is also a potential cause of strength decline in space, more specifically by altering acetylcholine signaling, again suggesting an interventional study is required to (dis)prove the casualty of this link."
Metabolic model predictions enable targeted microbiome manipulation through precision prebiotics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10846184/,"Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. IMPORTANCE While various mechanisms through which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome-based therapies. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. KEYWORDS: nutritional supplements, flux balance analysis, genome-scale metabolic models, Caenorhabditis elegans , Pseudomonas lurida MYb11, Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71, serine","Considering compounds that were identified across all three simulation approaches and cross-referencing with Biolog data revealed that 4-hydroxybenzoate, D-mannitol, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycerol-3-phosphate, L-serine, trehalose, L-threonine, and putrescine are potential precision prebiotics for MYb11. Thus, our proof-of-principle work demonstrates that constraint-based microbial community modeling approaches are an effective tool for the future development of targeted microbiome therapies using precision prebiotics. Also along these lines, we did use automatically reconstructed bacterial metabolic networks from our gapseq approach rather than manually curated networks which resembles the typical situation in the human gut microbiota where a detailed manual reconstruction of the hundreds to thousands of already detected and sequenced bacterial species is practically impossible."
Transcriptomics analysis reveals molecular alterations underpinning spaceflight dermatology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166967/,"Abstract Background Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. Methods To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4. Results Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage & repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression.","Here, we analyzed data from the skin of space flown mice and astronauts to try and identify possible explanations for these skin problems. It appears that changes in the activation of genes related to damage to DNA, skin barrier health, and mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of cells) may play a role in these skin problems. Further research will be needed to confirm exactly how these changes influence skin health, which could lead to solutions for preventing and managing such issues in astronauts."

We first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the C. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface-sterilization, implying distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well-studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in naturalized contexts.","We conducted a well-established cuticle fragility assay and observed the consistent role of mCeMbio and CBX151, a known cuticle-adherent bacterium, to promote cuticle integrity in the host, which varies across the individual bacterial species in mCeMbio ( Fig. This is highlighted by greater cuticle resistance in animals raised on the mCeMbio community (time to burst = 277 seconds) compared to all but one of the individual mCeMbio members, the gut-enriched strain Ochrobactrum MYb71 ( Fig. Given the symbiotic nature of the mCeMbio bacteria, which includes 11/12 published CeMbio strains; unique cuticle structures of the nematode skin such as the annuli, alae, or invagination sites; and community effects on promoting barrier function, our data support the existence of and role for a previously unappreciated C."
Protein kinase 2 of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 regulates mitochondrial morphology and function,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11487192/,"Abstract UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4.","elegans muscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolic activity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscle performance. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 required for fission, the morphology of indirect flight muscle resembled leg muscle with myofibrils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mitochondria located inside. After exercising mice for 1 h, the authors found that mitochondria were fragmented, total Drp1 and activated Drp1 were increased, oxidative stress was not increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained, pro-mitophagy proteins decreased, and mitochondrial respiration was increased."
New perspectives on viable microbial communities in low-biomass cleanroom environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554398/,"Abstract The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation.","Over the past 25 years, sequence analysis of PCR-amplified rRNA genes has become the ‘gold standard' for assessing species richness in mixed microbial communities, and as a result, total resolvable microbial diversity is now estimated to be threefold greater than that based solely on cultivation ( Pace, 1997 ). Similarly, sampling and sample processing steps (for example, the composition of the solution to collect and store microorganisms, method for cell concentration and PMA treatment) might affect the viability of the cells but in a recent study such adverse effect of sample handling procedures was not noticed for sea and canal water samples ( Kort et al. Such a capability is of crucial importance and benefit to numerous industries (for example, healthcare, pharma, semiconductor fabrication), not least of all the NASA, whose planetary protection program is tasked with ensuring spacecraft-borne microorganisms do not result in harmful contamination of extraterrestrial environments."
Microbial existence in controlled habitats and their resistance to space conditions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10370681/,"Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen load. In summary, LabC mice and WildR mice showed largely overlapping TB immunopathology and pathogen kinetics, with WildR mice controlling early acute infection better than LabC mice.","The lower lung bacterial load we observed at 1- and 14-days in WildR cohort might indicate a better early innate immune control in these mice, which quickly faded at later study time points ( Fig 1B ). The lower pathogen load in the lungs of WildR mice at 14 days post-infection did not translate into a measurable difference in pulmonary histopathology including the number of lesions and their organization and the absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in our studies correlated with the organ bacterial load rather than the microbiome changes (Figs 3 and 4 ). A principal component analysis of data revealed a clear separation of animals by time points post-infection but not between microbiomes ( Fig 5 ), demonstrating that cytokine and chemokine profiles during TB infection are independent of the gut microbiota."
Microbiomes of the dust particles collected from the International Space Station and Spacecraft assembly facilities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624184/,"Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique built environment due to the effects of microgravity, space radiation, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and especially continuous human habitation. A second objective was to determine if the built environments of Earth-based cleanrooms associated with space exploration are an appropriate model of the ISS environment. Results Samples collected from the ISS and two cleanrooms at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, Pasadena, CA) were analyzed by traditional cultivation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and propidium monoazide–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) assays to estimate viable microbial populations. Conclusions The results of this study provide strong evidence that specific human skin-associated microorganisms make a substantial contribution to the ISS microbiome, which is not the case in Earth-based cleanrooms.","The NRC recommended use of state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques to develop better microbial monitoring of future closed habitat(s) and response system(s) against potential biohazards originating from microbiological sources, using the ISS as a test bed [ 1 , 4 ]. A lower incidence of cultivable microorganisms in Earth cleanrooms than ISS surfaces suggests that regular thorough maintenance and cleaning practices are required to reduce microbial burden in closed habitats. Any microbial species that could withstand a prolonged period of time (~40 months during this study) requires survival capabilities against harsh conditions, and members of the Actinobacteria phylum are known to withstand desiccation, dry conditions, and high pH [ 33 , 34 ], which explains their abundance in ISS HEPA filters (~95.28 %; Table 3 )."

Human presence impacts fungal diversity of inflated lunar/Mars analog habitat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504618/,"Abstract Background An inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH), simulated closed system isolated by HEPA filtration, mimics International Space Station (ISS) conditions and future human habitation on other planets except for the exchange of air between outdoor and indoor environments. The internal transcribed spacer region-based iTag Illumina sequencing was employed to measure the community structure and fluctuation of the mycobiome over time in various locations. Treatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA; a DNA intercalating dye for selective detection of viable microbial populations) had a significant effect on the microbial diversity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Conclusions The results of this study revealed that the overall fungal diversity in the closed habitat changed during human presence; therefore, it is crucial to properly maintain a closed habitat to preserve it from deteriorating and keep it safe for its inhabitants.","It was also shown that the indoor mycobiome was mostly influenced by airborne fungi rather than human presence and their shedding, despite the fact that fungi were associated with human skin, lungs, urogenital tract, oral nasal cavities, and the gut [ 30 , 76 – 79 ]. A recent 6-month survey on Japanese astronauts on the ISS revealed that the most abundant (dead or alive) fungal genus was Malassezia [ 10 ] whereas in this study, the most frequent viable fungal genera of closed habitat were Epiccocum , Alternaria , and Pleosporales , which are environmental organisms rather than human commensals. Additionally, because of their ability to colonize the human body and produce toxins, volatile organic compounds, and proteases, the common molds ( Alternaria , Cladosporium , Epicoccum ) could damage airways of immunocompromised occupants, which make them more dangerous than any other allergenic source [ 82 – 85 ]."

Microbial Characteristics of ISS Environmental Surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421509/,"Abstract While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.","64 recently conducted elegant experiments using six ISS potable water microbial isolates (including some of the same species used in our study) and showed the contribution of individual community members to the robustness of polymicrobial biofilm formation. We recognize that our results may be explained by other possibilities, including (a) the limited number of strains tested in this study, (b) potential phenotypic changes that might result from culturing the isolates in our laboratory as opposed to microgravity conditions in spaceflight, (c) different nutrient availability between the ISS water system and conditions used in this study, (d) strains isolated in later years might have been introduced via contamination into the ISS water system, and (e) species compared over different time periods were represented by different strains. By profiling the functional phenotypes of ISS isolates over a series of kinetic timepoints, the results of this study offer potential insight into how polymicrobial isolates may contribute to biofouling of onboard life-support systems and impact human health in space and on Earth."

KatharoSeq enables high-throughput microbiome analysis from low-biomass samples,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5864415/,"Various indoor, outdoor, and host-associated environments contain small quantities of microbial biomass and represent a niche that is often understudied because of technical constraints. Many studies that attempt to evaluate these low-biomass microbiome samples are riddled with erroneous results that are typically false positive signals obtained during the sampling process. Here we present KatharoSeq, a high-throughput protocol combining laboratory and bioinformatic methods that can differentiate a true positive signal in samples with as few as 50 to 500 cells. KEYWORDS: 16S rRNA amplicon, Acinetobacter , Staphylococcus , Vibrio , abalone, built environment, low biomass, metagenomics, microbial ecology, neonatal intensive care unit, NICU","The KatharoSeq protocol integrates positive and negative controls, specific choices of high-throughput DNA extraction and bead cleanup kits, library construction and pooling strategies for amplicon sequencing or shotgun metagenomics, and bioinformatic sample exclusion protocols to achieve a high-throughput, sensitive, and specific method of probing low-biomass microbiomes. marcescens , a human pathogen associated with nosocomial infections and septicemia in the NICU ( 16 ), in a specific NICU room in multiple sample types 48 days after the initial positive culture but not in two adjacent rooms indicates the utility of KatharoSeq for biosurveillance monitoring. In particular, high-throughput analysis of epidemiological cohorts of banked plasma samples and household dust samples improved the detection and control of microbial contamination in semiconductor and spacecraft fabrication settings, including planetary protection applications, and forensic analysis of degraded or minuscule samples will greatly benefit from the utilization of this high-throughput, scalable protocol."

Detection of antimicrobial resistance genes associated with the International Space Station environmental surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9241228/,"Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 10 5 cfu/m 2 Conclusions Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.","Two recent studies have noted that the crew microbiome may shape microbial composition on ISS habitable surfaces [ 29 , 30 ], and in this study, the majority of bacteria and fungi that were detected from surfaces were human-associated, such as Staphylococcus , Propionibacterium , Streptococcus , Haemophilus , and Malassezia or those related to food products that are ingested by humans, such as Aspergillus kawachii and Lactococcus lactis . Aspergillus biofilms (i) cause aspergillosis, an infection causing allergic reactions, lung disease, and infections in other organs [ 45 , 46 ]; (ii) have been implicated in microbially induced corrosion of bronze and copper [ 47 ]; and (iii) have been found in tap water in private homes, hospitals, and industrial premises, resulting in altered taste, odor, the production of allergenic compounds, and mycotoxins [ 48 , 49 ]. This may be significant in the context of a recent study comparing “unrestricted” built environments (public houses, public buildings, private houses) with “confined” built environments (intensive care units (ICU), cleanrooms, cleanroom gowning areas) where it was shown that each of the three “confined” environments had a considerably higher representation of amino acid utilization compared to carbohydrate utilization, with the opposite being true for the “unrestricted” environments (higher carbohydrate utilization compared to amino acids) [ 50 ]."

Characterization of Aspergillus niger Isolated from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326050/,"Abstract Secondary metabolite (SM) production in Aspergillus niger JSC-093350089, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. The analysis revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones and therapeutically relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A. These findings include INDELs within the predicted promoter region of flbA , which encodes a developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation of Fum21. Keywords: secondary metabolites, Aspergillus niger , International Space Station, pyranonigrin A, antioxidant","While a recent study found that growth in ISS conditions is capable of altering SM production in Aspergillus nidulans ( Romsdahl et al., 2019 ), the metabolomic changes encountered in JSC-093350089, which are conserved on Earth, are likely the result of a substantial changes at the genomic or epigenomic level, which may have been selected for by pressures associated with ISS conditions, such as microgravity, enhanced radiation, and low nutrient availability. Interestingly, the spaceflight environment appeared to select for a strain that produces enhanced levels of therapeutically relevant SMs, including the antioxidant pyranonigrin A ( Miyake et al., 2007 ), the human cancer cytotoxic agent bicoumanigrin A ( Hiort et al., 2004 ), the antimicrobial aurasperone A ( Shaaban et al., 2012 ), and the antifungal and antioxidant aurasperone B ( Choque et al., 2015 ). These findings illustrate the therapeutic and economic potential associated with investigating metabolite production in microbes isolated from extreme environments and provide a framework for future efforts to genetically optimize production yields of the bioactive SMs described in this study."
Multi-drug resistant Enterobacter bugandensis species isolated from the International Space Station and comparative genomic analyses with human pathogenic strains,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6251167/,"Abstract Background The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypic properties, multiple drug resistance (MDR) gene profiles, and genes related to potential virulence and pathogenic properties of five Enterobacter bugandensis strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) were carried out and compared with genomes of three clinical strains. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon encoding MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, which regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12, was also observed in the ISS strains. Conclusion Given the MDR results for these ISS Enterobacter genomes and increased chance of pathogenicity (PathogenFinder algorithm with > 79% probability), these species pose important health considerations for future missions. Thorough genomic characterization of the strains isolated from ISS can help to understand the pathogenic potential, and inform future missions, but analyzing them in in-vivo systems is required to discern the influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity.","A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon was observed in ISS strains, which codes for protein MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, and regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12 [ 42 – 44 ]. Metal-dependent hydrolases, cation efflux system protein CusA, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein CzcA, DNA-binding heavy metal response regulator, Co/Zn/Cd efflux system membrane fusion protein, zinc transporter ZitB were found in both ISS isolate and nosocomial organism understudy. These become important for the future space studies, as MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to the substances like bile, hormone and host defense molecule [ 53 ], which can make bacteria a dominant persistor and lead to pathogenicity in humans."

"International Space Station conditions alter genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in Aspergillus nidulans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9098231/,"Abstract The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA , ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism.","Additionally, despite the various therapeutic and industrial applications of SMs, few studies have analyzed the global influence of space conditions on fungal secondary metabolism, as previous investigations have often focused on the production of a single SM ( Lam et al. Therefore, with the duration of space missions expected to increase, a major goal of this study was to investigate space-induced alternations in fungal ‘omics’ to identify specific adaptation biomarkers and acquire insight into potential benefits of fungi that may not be discernable using traditional methodology. Expsoure to the space environment appeared to curtail enhanced SM production in the laeA overexpression strain through the introduction of a point mutation that resulted in loss of the laeA stop codon, thereby activating nonstop decay degradation of laeA mRNA ( Hoof et al."
Proteomic characterization of Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from air and surfaces of the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9116463/,"Abstract The on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) revealed the presence of various microorganisms that may be affected by the distinct environment of the ISS. The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin.","Interestingly, such post-translational modifications play a role in several cellular processes in eukaryotes, including cell growth regulation and environmental adaptation, suggesting their importance in gaining survival advantage 86 . Such comparison has enabled the identification of possible adaptation responses to the unique microgravity environment of the ISS, which includes increased abundance of stress response related proteins, and modulation of proteins involved in carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Complex analyses of possible molecular alterations triggered by microgravity and enhanced irradiation will be pertinent to the future long-term manned space flights, as such an understanding is crucial for astronauts’ health and biodeterioration of the closed habitat."
Genomic Characterization and Virulence Potential of Two Fusarium oxysporum Isolates Cultured from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6426649/,"This is the first study to isolate and characterize F. oxysporum isolates from a built environment, as well as one that has been exposed to space. The characterization and analysis of these two genomes may have important implications for the medical, agricultural, and food industries as well as for the health of the crew who coinhabit the ISS with these strains. KEYWORDS: Fusarium , International Space Station, fungi, genomics","The phylogenetic placement of these two strains based on EF-1α nucleotide sequence and whole-genome SNPs shows that they are within the genetic variation of terrestrial strains and that their ability to thrive in the space environment was not contingent on enhanced genetic variation. Based on the number of SNPs across the genome, the phylogeny inferred using maximum likelihood from SNP sequences in both coding and noncoding regions, and the k-mer analysis, ISS-F3/F4 were not Fo47 or identical to any of the 65 strains compared in this study. One hypothesis is that ISS-F3/F4 are present in relatively low abundances on Earth but were selected because of their ability to withstand ISS-associated environmental pressures such as increased radiation, which compared to terrestrial indoor buildings, is 100 times greater."
Characterization of the total and viable bacterial and fungal communities associated with the International Space Station surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6452512/,"Abstract Background The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo, and crew that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. Results The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 10 4 to 10 9 CFU/m 2 depending on location and consisted of various bacterial ( Actinobacteria , Firmicutes , and Proteobacteria ) and fungal ( Ascomycota and Basidiomycota ) phyla. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation.","Correlating viable but opportunistic pathogens with crew member health is likely to raise too many questions about access to the crew microbiome data which is not yet publicly available, and about statistical power: because the ISS has few occupants and high turnover, identifying statistically relevant trends in crew member health that correlate with environmental microbiomes is not possible. Numerous studies conducted on Earth have shown that the type and amount of human activity in a particular location impacts that indoor microbiome [ 65 – 67 ] and while there were no differences in the average microbial load (by culture and qPCR) nor community structure (amplicon sequencing), it was clear that there were variations between sampling points across different locations. We do not believe that the choice of primers, nor the separate sequencing runs, have influenced the differences in temporal distribution presented in this manuscript for the following reasons: (i) Additional file 5 : Table S2 shows the organisms that were statistically significantly different over time and shows the efficiency of each primer pair in detecting these organisms, which are almost identical."
Proteomic and Metabolomic Characteristics of Extremophilic Fungi Under Simulated Mars Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6529585/,"Abstract Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches. Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated and ISS-isolated strains were tested for UV-C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in strain-dependent survival. Keywords: fungi, simulated mars conditions, proteome, metabolome, Chernobyl, international space station, extremophiles","The results from this study, combined with those revealing that cryptoendolithic fungal communities embedded in rocks can withstand SMC for an extended period of time ( Onofri et al., 2012 , 2015 ; Pacelli et al., 2018 ), imply that fungi should be considered as a possible forward contamination source. sphaerospermum, Wangiella dermatitidis , and Cryptococcus neoformans showed increased growth when compared to unexposed controls due to electronic changes in melanin ( Dadachova et al., 2007 ), however, in our study only ISSFT-021-30 seemed to follow that pattern, revealing up-regulation of translation-related proteins. Thorough understanding of how filamentous fungi adapt to space conditions is important for both maintaining crew health and preventing biocorrosion of the spacecraft, as both opportunistic pathogenic fungi ( Knox et al., 2016 ) and technophiles ( Alekhova et al., 2005 ) have been reported on board of the ISS and Mir space stations."
MetaMiner: A Scalable Peptidogenomics Approach for Discovery of Ribosomal Peptide Natural Products with Blind Modifications from Microbial Communities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6952069/,"Summary Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are an important class of natural products that contain antibiotics and a variety of other bioactive compounds. The existing methods for discovery of RiPPs by combining genome mining and computational mass spectrometry are limited to discovering specific classes of RiPPs from small datasets, and they fail to handle unknown post-translational modifications.

Assessing the risk of transfer of microorganisms at the International Space Station due to cargo delivery by commercial resupply vehicles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677455/,"Abstract Background With increasing numbers of interplanetary missions, there is a need to establish robust protocols to ensure the protection of extraterrestrial planets being visited from contamination by terrestrial life forms. The current study is the first report comparing the commercial resupply vehicle (CRV) microbiome with the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome to understand the risks of contamination, thus serving as a model system for future planetary missions. Results Samples obtained from the internal surfaces and ground support equipment of three CRV missions were subjected to various molecular techniques for microbial diversity analysis. These findings suggest that the maintenance protocols in cleaning CRV surfaces are highly effective in controlling the contaminating microbial population during cargo transfer to the ISS via the CRV route.","The cultivable strains also included members of the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus , which are often encountered in SAF environments and can withstand harsh conditions (e.g., desiccation, low nutrients, and radiation) because of their spore formation ability ( Vaishampayan et al., 2012 ). Similarly, routine maintenance and cleaning procedures could presumably have removed most of the bacterial taxa associated with the SAF cleanrooms, however, spore-forming bacteria and members of Actinobacteria and Massilia persist in these environments ( Vaishampayan et al., 2013 ; Mahnert et al., 2015 ). Therefore, even though a certain low number of microorganisms are carried via CRV to the ISS, most of them will be outcompeted by the existing ISS microbiome, potentially rendering them undetectable in both traditional microbiology assays and state-of-the-art metagenome sequencing."
"Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., isolated from the International Space Station",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8005752/,"Abstract Four strains belonging to the family of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights.

Advances in Space Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12034939/,"Immunogenetic diversity aids individuals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. We discuss patterns of variation along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and place this in the context of Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories. As climate change accelerates and emerging parasites spread, reduced immunogenetic diversity could severely threaten wildlife populations, compromising their resilience and long‐term survival. We propose that including immunogenetic diversity into a larger database of environmental and parasite data would allow biologists to test hypotheses regarding host–parasite coevolution and develop effective measures for conservation.","Ongoing research of parasite‐driven selective processes under natural conditions should focus on characterizing MHC genetic variation at complete class I and II loci from well‐assembled and well‐annotated genomes and transcriptomes. In addition, changes in adaptive versus neutral marker allele frequencies over time should contribute to understanding the relative contribution of drift, selection, and parasite‐mediated selection mechanisms in shaping patterns of functional diversity. Wildlife conservation efforts that monitor MHC genetic diversity across space and time—at the edges of species distributions, in long‐term fragmented habitats, or at northern latitudes—will be most effective for ensuring long‐term species preservation in the face of climate change and emerging diseases."
Effects of simulated microgravity on the proteome and secretome of the polyextremotolerant black fungus Knufia chersonesos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8012687/,"Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity—one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions—by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant.","More specifically, an LSSMG-dependent increase in membrane fluidity attributable to a higher USFA/SFA ratio was previously demonstrated by studies in plain lipid membranes, various microorganisms e.g., Escherichia coli and plants upon exposure to microgravity ( Sieber et al., 2014 ; Kim and Rhee, 2016 ; Kordyum and Chapman, 2017 ). Proteins involved in translation, transcription and RNA metabolic process were significantly more upregulated in the mutant proteome than in the wild type (up to 9-fold, as in the case of ribosomal proteins L32, L36, S30 and L37), whereas the mutant secretome showed increased abundance of a number of hydrolases required for the breakdown of biopolymers and cell wall components ( Supplementary Figure 5 ). However, decreased levels of common stress proteins and lack of a heat shock response (HSP) represent a key component of black fungi response to a variety of suboptimal conditions of growth and have been attributed to an energy-saving strategy that relies on a fine-tuning regulation of protein abundance ( Tesei et al., 2012 , 2015 ; Zakharova et al., 2013 , 2014 ; Blasi et al., 2017 )."

Microbial transcripts enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a potential method for on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production.","For example, the high number of reads that mapped to the two-component system pathway might suggest the need to sense and quickly respond to environmental factors by phosphorylating and dephosphorylating proteins, whereas the plant–pathogen interaction pathway could indicate a biotic stress response 59 . The MAPK pathway plays important roles in fungal physiology and development, as it governs diverse growth processes such as mating, cell cycle control, morphogenesis (e.g., filamentation), response to different stresses, cell wall assembly and integrity, pathogenicity, cell to cell signaling, fungal–plant interactions, and response to damage-associated molecular patterns 61 – 63 . Currently, many of the commercially available portable rapid plant disease diagnostic tools are based on immunodetection methods (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays), PCR-based assays, and spectrometry-based protocols, which require some prior prediction of the microbial organisms that are being tested, to design antibodies or PCR primers for the analyses 65 , 66 ."
Investigation of Spaceflight Induced Changes to Astronaut Microbiomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988970/,"This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function.","The serum metabolome results, serving as macroscopic manifestations and preliminary diagnostic bases for the body’s condition, revealed obvious disorders in lipid and amino acid metabolism, as well as abnormalities in the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems in the model group mice compared to the WT group. In this study, the livers of the model group mice showed diffuse microvesicular/macrovesicular steatosis, inflammation and infiltration of inflammatory cells, as well as abnormalities in antioxidant indicators such as T-AOC (total antioxidant capacity), SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and GSH-Px (glutathione peroxidase). In order to explore the possible relationships among metabolite changes, gut microbiota alterations, and apparent liver–brain metabolic disorders under microgravity stress, this study used MetaMapp (version 2.0.1 45) to analyze the interactions between different metabolites and screen for key metabolites in the stress response of mice induced by microgravity at the metabolic level."
Genomic Characterization of Potential Plant Growth-Promoting Features of Sphingomonas Strains Isolated from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8754149/,"Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as Sphingomonas sanguinis ( n = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as Sphingomonas paucimobilis . Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.","Future applications of metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses under space or simulated microgravity conditions will likely be prudent for identifying patterns of metabolic flux in response to tryptophan supplementation, thereby elucidating potential mechanisms for IAA production in these bacteria. sanguinis spaceflight isolates showed the presence of tra genes involved in pilus assembly and conjugal transfer ( traF , trbC , traU , traW , trbI , traC , traV , traB , traK , traE , traL , and traH ) and those involved in mating pair stabilization ( traG and traN ), which were absent in the type strain ( 46 ).

Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens . The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity.","Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region rRNA gene, D1/D2 domain of large subunit (LSU or 26S) rRNA gene, small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA gene, and housekeeping genes, including two subunits of RNA polymerase II ( RPB1 and RPB2 ), translation elongation factor 1-α ( TEF1 ), and cytochrome b ( CYTB ), which were used for differentiating Tremellomycetes species [ 2 ]. Much further work is needed to better identify novel structures within the Titan-like cells, categorize the specific modifications that are occurring to organelles within the cells, determine how each of the cellular modifications alters the cells’ survivability in extreme environments (pH ranges, temperature ranges, osmotic shock, radiation exposure, etc.), and determine if these traits are passed on to their progeny. tulchinskyi cells did not utilize Cellobiose, Arbutin, D-Galactose, Glycerol, Hexadecane, L-Malic acid, L-Rhamnose, Lactose, Mannitol, Melezitose, Methyl a-glucoside, Myo-inositol, Raffinose, Xylitol, Citrate, Melibiose, Meso erythritol, Glucono D-lactone, Inulin, and N-acetyl D-glucosamine as sole carbon source."
Metabolic modeling of the International Space Station microbiome reveals key microbial interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9258157/,"Abstract Background Recent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae . Results Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These complementary approaches provided insights into the metabolic interactions and dependencies present amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key interactions and keystone species. This integrated modeling approach, combined with experiments, demonstrates the potential for understanding the organization of other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies.","The cleaning reagent used in ISS consists of benzalkonium chloride, which might be able to eradicate the fungal population; thus fungal succession was not observed, unlike bacterial members which were persistent in the ISS locations examined [ 42 ]. On applying graph-theoretical algorithms and surveying the microbiome at multiple levels, we predicted that among the families in the dataset, members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were perhaps the most beneficial to other microorganisms in the community, whereas in most cases, members of the families such as Erwiniaceae, Staphylococcaceae and Sporidiobolaceae (yeast) offered little or no additional metabolic benefit to the community. The members of the family Sporidiobolaceae ( Rhodotorula, pink yeast) were isolated from the ISS locations [ 8 ], their antagonistic and parasitic behavior predicted during this study should be tested against opportunistic microbial pathogens to aid in the development of appropriate countermeasures."
"Microbial Burden Estimation of Food Items, Built Environments, and the International Space Station Using Film Media",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9503880/,"Abstract The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.","Other disadvantages of film media are that (1) because of the smaller surface area and the miniaturization of colonies, it was difficult to count colonies by eye for high bioburden samples, and in a few cases, counting from magnified photographs was necessary (3M has developed an automated CFU counter for use with Petrifilm plates, which negates this issue), and (2) because colony color was not observable, and morphology was somewhat obscured in film media, it would be extremely difficult to rule out the colonies of a known contaminant that appeared also in control plates (for example, in a situation where samples are plated out in the field or in otherwise non-laboratory conditions). Human habitation and the accompanying presence of dust, fibers, and hairs from bodies and cloth, combined with extremely low surface biomass due to constant cleaning and well-filtered air, is a combination peculiar to hospital environments [ 40 ], clean rooms [ 41 ], and space habitats [ 42 , 43 ]; however, because astronauts do not wear masks, gloves, or other protective equipment aboard the ISS, the problem of hairs and fibers is exacerbated. In a study of debris and lint collected via vacuuming the ISS surfaces, fibers and hairs—as opposed to tinier particles such as skin cells with a greater surface area—yielded a distinct microbial community with greater fungal diversity and only one order of magnitude fewer cultivable microbes than powdery debris despite a vastly smaller surface area [ 42 ]."
Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter pittii is adapting to and exhibiting potential succession aboard the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9743659/,"Abstract Background Monitoring the adaptation of microorganisms to the extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is crucial to understanding microbial evolution and infection prevention. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ISS strains and two related clinical isolates demonstrated that ISS strains acquired more resistance, specifically with regard to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, despite no prediction of increased resistance based on genomic analysis of resistance genes. Via a genome-wide association study, we identified a high level of mutational burden in methionine sulfoxide reductase genes relative to the most closely related Earth strains. Conclusions Overall, these results indicated a step forward in understanding how microorganisms might evolve and alter their antibiotic resistance phenotype in extreme, resource-limited, human-built environments.","This de-represses transcription of multiple SOS genes, which halt cell division and lysis, initiate DNA repair, and induce mutagenesis directed by error-prone polymerases, as well as partially regulating toxin-antitoxin activity and biofilm formation [ 20 , 21 ]. Multiple genes, including umuDAb and ddrR , which are unique to Acinetobacter appear to serve a similar role to lexA , but only for a subset of SOS genes; research continues in this area since antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter as a result of SOS mutagenesis is a pressing problem for human health [ 23 , 24 ]. In bacteria, certain deletions in msrA and msrB can lead to species-specific effects such as decreased resistance to oxidants and cleaning products, decreased antibiotic resistance, decreased virulence, and decreased ability to survive within a eukaryotic host [ 26 ] For example, Salmonella typhimurium msrA knockout mutants are 3000x more sensitive to hypochlorite and less able to survive inside a host cell [ 3 , 27 ]."

In that regard, environmental stress would have no effect on that gene since a change in the gene sequence would not serve to increase the rate of biofilm production and increase the overall amount of biofilm formed, but we can also see that there is a decent amount of amino acid change in the LsrC gene which is responsible for importing the autoinducer, and this makes sense because while the autoinducer itself does not need to be changed, the rate at which it is imported to carry information needs to be increased or reduced to accommodate for the change in the amount of biofilm produced."

Adaptation to space conditions of novel bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station revealed by functional gene annotations and comparative genome analysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11451251/,"Abstract Background The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","The pool of novel genes unique to the ISS species (Supplementary Table S13 ) showed an abundance of genes related to peptide and small molecule synthesis, transmembrane secretion/transport, and mechanosensitive ion channels. vandeheii genome showcasing the most substantial presence of MGEs. On the other hand, transposable elements were not detected in all ISS species, thus suggesting that TE-mediated genome rearrangements are not a common route for genomic adaptations to space environment.

Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae.","Although the animals treated in this study received radiation to their entire thoracic spine, extrapolation from these data could help shape our expectations of the types of bone changes we should anticipate following more localized treatments like SBRT. Moreover, exposure of young mice to high dose radiation of 7.25 Gy has been shown to reduce circulating biomarkers of bone formation and osteoblast activity, including sclerostin and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide ( 50 ). The cohort of NHPs chosen were based on available samples at the intitation of the study, thus age and weight matching was not possible, however this enabled us to detect that younger NHPs are more radiation sensitive in terms of both bone loss and reaching endpoints associated with pneunonitis."

Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Our findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to spaceflight-relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype.

Recent studies show prolonged Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Altogether, our results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, and to a lesser extent, BRCA2, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of nuclear import may play a key role in its carcinogenic mechanism since the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair proteins is crucial to their function.","The inhibition of the high fidelity DNA repair pathway, homologous recombination, allows for the development of Cr(VI)-induced structural chromosome instability ( Browning et al., 2016 ; Qin et al., 2014 ; Stackpole et al., 2007 ). Although the increases in cytoplasmic localization of these interactions were not significant, alongside our observations of Cr(VI)-induced subcellular mislocalization of RAD51C and BRCA2, these data further support that prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits nuclear import. Our results suggest an inhibition of nuclear import, which could play a pivotal role in the mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis as the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair protein is crucial to their function."
"Transcriptomics, NF-Œ∫B Pathway, and Their Potential Spaceflight-Related Health Consequences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5485990/,"Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures.

This review intends to summarize the transcriptomics studies that identified NF-κB as a responsive pathway to ground-based simulated microgravity or the true spaceflight condition. In addition, the review summarizes the studies that focused specifically on NF-κB pathway in specific cell types or organ tissues as related to the known spaceflight-related health risks including immune dysfunction, bone loss, muscle atrophy, central nerve system (CNS) dysfunction, and risks associated with space radiation.","Such evidence was found in transcriptomics studies that explored all possible pathways, and in experiments targeting specifically NF-κB across different cell types and organ tissues.

The identification of genes affected by the space environment allows researchers to explore potential protein networks and determine cellular pathways associated with spaceflight-related diseases."
Interplay of space radiation and microgravity in DNA damage and DNA damage response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5460239/,"Abstract In space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and space radiation, pose constant threat to the DNA integrity of living organisms. Although organisms have evolved strategies on Earth to confront such damage, space environmental conditions, especially microgravity, can impact DNA repair resulting in accumulation of severe DNA lesions. Ultimately these lesions, namely double strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, micronucleus formation, or mutations, can increase the risk for adverse health effects, such as cancer. The review also discusses the conflicting results from studies aimed at addressing the question of potential synergies between microgravity and radiation with regard to DNA damage and cellular repair processes.","While many studies have reported increased sensitivity to radiation and decreased DNA repair under simulated microgravity (Table 1 ), most of the experiments conducted in space have shown no effects of spaceflight on the capacity of the cells to repair the artificially induce DNA damage (Table 2 ), both within and across model systems. Indeed, suggestions for this come from studies showing that exposure of human primary cells to protons followed by heavy Ti or Fe ions resulted in a yield of transformation that is greater than the sum of the yields when the cells were independently exposed to protons or heavy particles. Dual exposures of C57BL/6 mice to protons and Fe ions resulted in pronounced molecular alterations in comparison with either source of radiation alone, as measured by a substantial increase in the expression of cytokine IL-13, loss of expression of DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1, and reactivation of LINE-1, SINE B1 retrotransposons, and major and minor satellites."

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy γ-radiation, and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant synergistic effects on the expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2). RWVs may be a useful tool to provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, providing benefit not only to astronauts but also to patients suffering from immune disorders or undergoing radiotherapy.","It has been reported that activated human T cells cultured in RWVs present alterations in expression of genes involved in several cellular processes such as signal transduction, DNA repair, apoptosis, immune and inflammatory responses, and metabolic pathways [ 55 ]. Within dose groups, linear mixed model regression analyses take baseline interindividual differences into account; therefore uncertainties in the estimates of the contrasting effects are due to random interactions between the individuals and the experimental conditions. Nevertheless, the fact that our data confirmed radiation-induced dysregulation of genes involved in DNA damage response in a dose dependent manner supports our strategy as a plausible alternative way for evaluating gene expression analysis."
Transcriptome and proteome responses in RNAlater preserved tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5397022/,"RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid nitrogen.

This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.","[ 4 ] performed a comparison of snap-frozen samples to five preservative solutions (SDS-extraction buffer, ethanol, trichloroacetic acid, B-PER, and RNAlater) on the proteome integrity of cyanobacterium Synechococcus WH8102 and found that, after four weeks of preservation, RNAlater was the superior preservative and did not significantly alter the proteome compared to snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. Indeed, genes associated with desiccation and osmotic homeostasis were the most enriched categories, suggesting that the transcript differences are a result of a cellular response to RNAlater ( Fig 1B ), potentially caused by an uneven preservation of cells as RNAlater diffuses across a tissue. Thus, the rate of tissue infiltration allows a short-term alteration in transcription, but the RNAlater successfully inhibits the translational machinery before a substantial amount of protein is produced or degraded."

Conclusions The datasets gathered from Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to microgravity revealed marked impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox/microtubule dynamics, and plastid gene transcription. What’s more, addressing the effects of microgravity on AHA2, CESA1, and alpha tubulins has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing biomass production and growth in microgravity.","Multiple ‘omics approaches yield distinct but comparable results The transcript, protein, and post-translational modification data reported here demonstrate that cellular perturbations caused by microgravity are likely pervasive across all “levels” of regulation. As microtubules provide the patterning for CESA-mediated cellulose deposition, enhancing the impact of this compensatory adaptation (i.e. microtubule stabilization) could be a highly effective target for enhancing plant growth and biomass generation in the absence of gravity. In the case of gravity signaling, the traditional approaches of genetic mutant screens and RNA-seq have failed to identify some of the signaling components of the pathway, suggesting that post-translational modification of potentially redundant proteins, rather than alterations of their levels, may be responsible."

With the next era of space exploration upon us, which will see crewed missions to the Moon and Mars in the next 10 years, incorporating microbiology research into planning, decision-making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring success of these long-duration missions. These can include astronaut microbiome studies to protect against infections, immune system dysfunction and bone deterioration, or biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU) studies that incorporate microbes to act as radiation shields, create electricity and establish robust plant habitats for fresh food and recycling of waste. In this review, information will be presented on the beneficial use of microbes in bioregenerative life support systems, their applicability to bISRU, and their capability to be genetically engineered for biotechnological space applications.","Within the next decade, great strides will be made in space exploration with the combined efforts of NASA and other space agencies to reach the Moon and Mars, as well as the expansion of commercialized spaceflight. Microbes are ideal candidates to aid in human survival during long-term space travel due to their many beneficial characteristics, ease of manipulation, and microscopic size, allowing them to be easily stowed without the concern of added weight. This review has presented the vast contributions that microbes can make towards future crewed missions, human habitability and sustainability and hopefully encourages more space-related microbial research interconnected with technological development, to continue to safely advance deep space exploration in the upcoming decade."
Toward sustainable space exploration: A roadmap for harnessing the power of microorganisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10030976/,"Abstract Finding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth–orbit, but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.","It has been discussed how microbial biotechnologies may support several processes that, in turn, can help decrease supply chain dependency (from Earth) on long-duration deep-space exploration missions to eventually enable human footholds and settlements across the solar system. Augmenting existing space-based facilities to increase the capacity for space experiments, in terms of sample replicates and experimental conditions, should also be considered to improve the impact of the preliminary studies. Finally, the potential of these technologies for terrestrial benefits has been discussed, with specific reference to the United Nation SDGs. If ultra-efficient approaches to sustaining human life and economic activity off-Earth can be adapted towards meaningfully solving problems on our planet, space exploration will have yielded a manifold return on public investments and will thereby become more sustainable not only technologically, but also politically."
Longitudinal characterization of multispecies microbial populations recovered from spaceflight potable water,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421509/,"Abstract While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.","64 recently conducted elegant experiments using six ISS potable water microbial isolates (including some of the same species used in our study) and showed the contribution of individual community members to the robustness of polymicrobial biofilm formation. We recognize that our results may be explained by other possibilities, including (a) the limited number of strains tested in this study, (b) potential phenotypic changes that might result from culturing the isolates in our laboratory as opposed to microgravity conditions in spaceflight, (c) different nutrient availability between the ISS water system and conditions used in this study, (d) strains isolated in later years might have been introduced via contamination into the ISS water system, and (e) species compared over different time periods were represented by different strains. By profiling the functional phenotypes of ISS isolates over a series of kinetic timepoints, the results of this study offer potential insight into how polymicrobial isolates may contribute to biofouling of onboard life-support systems and impact human health in space and on Earth."
Designing a Novel Monitoring Approach for the Effects of Space Travel on Astronauts‚Äô Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9964234/,"Abstract Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways.","Analysis of the Post-flight dataset showed that returning to ground did not significantly improve genome regulation and coordination of gene expression ( Figure 1 C), implying that the effect of space travel on human health is more profound and longer lasting than currently thought. As we progress towards crewed missions into outer space (for example, to the Moon and Mars) and other prolonged space stays, it is critical to develop rapid approaches to monitor genome regulation and establish corresponding protocols to alleviate the effects of space travel on human health. Because liver is a major organ for drug metabolism, a systematic space pharmacology study is needed to establish drug profiles—including dosing, ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), and even formulation—in preparation for future voyages into outer space."

Overexpression of CupB5 activates alginate overproduction in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a novel AlgW-dependent mechanism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4116675/,"aeruginosa , alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the alternative sigma factor AlgU. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the c haperone- u sher p athway gene cupB5 . These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.","Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW.

Burn injury-associated MHCII(+) immune cell accumulation around lymphatic vessels of the mesentery and increased lymphatic endothelial permeability are blocked by doxycycline treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5810432/,"Abstract It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.","48 Recent findings have shown that lymphatic contractile function (not transport) as measured ex vivo is compromised after burn injury and in the light of this data and our previous studies suggest that this impaired contractile function may be caused by the accumulation of immune cells surrounding the vessels and altering the local environment. Given our previous data in a model of inflammatory bowel disease, we may presume that it is likely a chemokine signal such as granulocyte/monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released by activated immune cells in the gut and carried in the lymph. The reduced score we found in doxycycline-treated burn cells may be evidence that these local lymphatic-associated immune cells can be activated in response to an aberrant signal in lymph, but need a secondary signal which may come from outside the vessel to increase their association with the vessel."
CubeSats for microbiology and astrobiology research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10261121/,"The International Space Station (ISS) is an excellent example of a highly successful and long-lasting research platform for experiments in space, that has provided a wealth of scientific data over the last two decades. In this perspective, the European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team Astrobiology and Astrochemistry (with feedback from the wider scientific community) identifies a number of key topics and summarizes the 2021 “ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper” for astrobiology and astrochemistry. We highlight recommendations for the development and implementation of future experiments, discuss types of in situ measurements, experimental parameters, exposure scenarios and orbits, and identify knowledge gaps and how to advance scientific utilization of future space-exposure platforms that are either currently under development or in an advanced planning stage. We also provide an outlook for in situ experiments on the Moon and Mars, and welcome new possibilities to support the search for exoplanets and potential biosignatures within and beyond our solar system.","With the advent of artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics, performing more complex scientific experiments beyond Earth is becoming increasingly feasible and enables addressing important questions in the fields of astrobiology and astrochemistry, highlighted in the introduction to this perspective. While ground experiments can provide a cost-effective means to acquire preliminary data in preparation for space experiments, having access to space environments via the space platforms discussed is critical to perform astrochemistry experiments in their native environments thus allowing the simulation of important astrophysical, astrochemical and planetary conditions more faithfully than Earth-based facilities. Beyond the solar system, and in the rapidly expanding field of exoplanetary sciences, new space platforms and telescopes play a pivotal role in understanding planetary habitability and possibly detecting signs of life, which has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of life in the universe."
In situ resource utilisation: The potential for space biomining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8739323/,"Space biomining of the Moon, Mars and asteroids has been indicated as one of the promising approaches to achieve in-situ resource utilization by the main space agencies. Structural and expensive metals, essential mineral nutrients, water, oxygen and volatiles could be potentially extracted from extraterrestrial regolith and rocks using microbial-based biotechnologies. Relevant differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions exist, including the rock types and ores available for mining, and a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be a possibility. It is, therefore, necessary to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications to learn the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expand our knowledge on organotrophic and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well as on anaerobic biomining, and investigate the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations posed by the space environments.","Moreover, many rocks in the Solar System would be considered low-grade ores for terrestrial standards (Cockell and Santomartino, in press), and biomining on Earth is commonly used to process mine waste, dumps and tailings (Bosecker 1997 ; Mishra and Rhee 2014 ). While most terrestrial biomining knowledge is based on autotrophic microorganisms able to break down sulphidic minerals without the need of carbon compounds, many rocks in the Solar Systems may present a low sulphur content.

"Simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities on Earth‚Äîeffects on Escherichia coli growth, phenotype, and sensitivity to antibiotics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9502502/,"An Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM. With this setup, growth dynamics, phenotypic changes, and sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three Escherichia coli strains (including uropathogenic) were examined under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. Clinostat-produced results can be considered suggestive but not determinative of what might be expected in altered gravity, as there is still a need to systematically verify these simulation devices’ ability to accurately replicate phenomena observed in space. Keywords: clinostat, minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC, rpoS, cell size, aggregation, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, urinary tract infection, UTI, spaceflight","More importantly, it is acknowledged that a systematic verification of the validity of clinostats (and rotating wall vessels like HARV, and of random positioning machines, for that matter) needs to be performed by either including clinostat sets in spaceflight experiments, or flying experiments with clinorotated Earth controls (varying angular velocity, for example) with this very specific goal. Comparing these results with spaceflight data shows that these increases in exponential growth rate do not agree with the EcAMSat spaceflight mission, which found that the growth rate of AMG1 and ∆ rpoS strains was unaltered by the microgravity environment [ 40 ], although it should be noted that it was acknowledged that their cells may have been under stress from the culturing hardware, and that different media were used in the two experiments. Nevertheless, our inclined clinostat and in-house code methodology may enable preliminary partial gravity studies to be performed on Earth by other teams, with the caveat that this methodology (just like all reduced gravity simulation devices including clinostats, rotating wall vessels, and random positioning machines) still need to go through a thorough verification and validation process using spaceflight assets."
Biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in spaceflight is minimized on lubricant impregnated surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10432549/,"Abstract The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts’ health. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm reduction on LIS are discussed.","The gene expression analysis of biofilms formed on LIS with respect to SS suggests several other hypotheses of mechanisms contributing to the reduced biofilm formation: (1) Increased expression of pyochelin genes (on Earth and in microgravity) and of rhamnolipid genes (only on Earth), which are produced in nitrogen-limited environments 83 , could reflect exacerbated nutrient depletion in the extracellular environment of LIS biofilms in comparison with SS. In addition, the use of directly immobilized DNA/RNA over surfaces (e.g., using covalent bonding, physical adsorption, or streptavidin-biotin immobilization 86 , 87 ) should also be explored to reduce bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in susceptible spacecraft components. Future studies, namely those focused on spacecraft water processing assemblies may improve on the fidelity of their study by using Ersatz Wastewater formulation to replicate the wastewater as received on the ISS’ system, extend the duration of the experiment to multiples of months as applicable, and the substrate material may be changed to that of the specific component being studied."
Competitive Growth Assay of Mutagenized Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Compatible With the International Space Station Veggie Plant Growth Chamber.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261848/,"Abstract A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay.","The enriched molecular functions are predicted to be processes necessary for Chlamydomonas to adapt to the UV mutagenesis, lack of media agitation, the diffusion of gases across the FEP membrane, and the lighting conditions in the Veggie unit. Although it is not yet designated as a GRAS organism by the FDA, Chlamydomonas is non-toxic; animal feeding studies show no harmful effects at 4 g algae biomass per kg body weight per day, the highest consumption levels tested ( Murbach et al., 2018 ). Our current study shows both feasibility for a spaceflight experiment and identifies a series of cellular information processing genes that are likely required for Chlamydomonas to adapt to batch culture in breathable plastic bags."
Spatial Characterization of Microbial Communities on Multi-Species Leafy Greens Grown Simultaneously in the Vegetable Production Systems on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8537831/,"Abstract The establishment of steady-state continuous crop production during long-term deep space missions is critical for providing consistent nutritional and psychological benefits for the crew, potentially improving their health and performance. Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce ( Lactuca sativa cv. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick.","These differences could be the result of many factors, including the different configuration of the three crops in each Veggie, the environmental conditions present at the time of the grow-out, i.e., temperature, CO 2 and humidity, crew interaction, microbes present in the surrounding air, and irrigation water. The genus Burkholderia contains over 60 known species and was abundant in many of the Veggie samples, primarily in the pillow substrate, root tissue, and wicks, but in very low abundance or was absent in leaf tissue indicating the genus may have been introduced through the water source or possibly was present in the seed. Methylobacterium are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens [ 74 , 75 ] and is a methylotrophic with the ability to utilize methanol produced by plants as a carbon source [ 76 ] Janthinobacterium is a soil bacterium with a wide range of metabolic activities, including antimicrobial properties and resistance to stressors such as UV radiation and cold temperatures providing a benefit to plants [ 77 , 78 , 79 ]."
Response of Arabidopsis thaliana and Mizuna mustard seeds to simulated space radiation exposures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8879990/,"Abstract One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). In this study, we evaluated the effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop plant Mizuna mustard [ Brassica rapa var. Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). After exposure to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated Arabidopsis seeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions causing more severe defects.","For future missions back to the Moon or on to Mars, living organisms will be exposed constantly to GCR and occasionally to particles from large solar particle events (SPE), even with effective shielding from the structural materials of vehicles, surface bases, the Martian atmosphere, and the Moon and Mars themselves. In contrast, under a different space environmental condition in the LDEF flight, tomato seeds maintained at a controlled climate of 14 psi with 15% humidity at an altitude between 175 to 275 nautical miles only showed that the pores of the strophiole region of the flight seeds were larger in size than those in the ground control seeds, which might affect germination [ 12 ]. For other space radiation related research platforms, in a very recent experiment using the Cosmic Ray Exposure Sequencing Science (CRESS) payload system, a 1U CubeSat design, Arabidopsis seeds (under 1 atm) were exposed to the stratosphere (36–40 km) environment above Antarctica in a 30-day, long-duration high altitude balloon mission [ 45 ]."

Metagenomic interrogation of urban Superfund site reveals antimicrobial resistance reservoir and bioremediation potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11999716/,"Abstract Aims We investigate the bioremediation potential of the microbiome of the Gowanus Canal, a contaminated waterway in Brooklyn, NY, USA, designated a Superfund site by the US Environmental Protection Agency due to high concentrations of contaminants, including polychlorinated biphenyls, petrochemicals, and heavy metals. We demonstrate that the resident microbiome includes 455 species, including extremophiles across a range of saltwater and freshwater species, which collectively encode 64 metabolic pathways related to organic contaminant degradation and 1171 genes related to heavy metal utilization and detoxification. Furthermore, our genetic screening reveals an environmental reservoir of antimicrobial resistance markers falling within 8 different classes of resistance, as well as de-novo characterization of 2319 biosynthetic gene clusters and diverse groups of secondary metabolites with biomining potential. Conclusion The microbiome of the Gowanus Canal is a biotechnological resource of novel metabolic functions that could aid in efforts for bioremediation, AMR reservoir mapping, and heavy metal mitigation.","While heavy metals are essential cofactors in many cellular processes, high heavy metal concentrations are also a stressor and microbes adapt by developing resistance mechanisms, including chelation and efflux (Anastassopoulou and Theophanides 1995 , Lemire et al. Moving forward with either of these options requires considering the ethics of interventions on non-human organisms, because even though we can’t relate to microbes in the way we can to beasts of burden, “harnessing” them still implies making resources through labor (Krzywoszynska 2020 ). These results outline the potential of this Superfund site and other contaminated sites across the world to be case studies to uncover the mechanics of interactions between antimicrobial resistance, environmental contamination, and microbial community dynamics."
"In situ monitoring of barrier function on-chip via automated, non-invasive luminescence sensing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11969330/,"Abstract Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function under cytokine-induced inflammation.","With the terminal end of the fiber optic cable in proximity (∼500 μm or less) to the culture volume of interest, excitation and emission luminescence may be sensed with a high signal-to-noise ratio, offering non-invasive delivery and collection of light with 92% visible light transmission. Importantly, our sensing platform required no change or optimization when transitioning from Caco-2 cells to HUVECs. This technology is easily integrated into our laser cut and assemble method for fabricating OOCs. This method keeps the manufacturing costs of culture platforms down and allows fiber stubs to be swapped from one experimental OOC to another without signal degradation. 58 Applying custom high-density fiber arrays to organ chips may allow for whole-chip spatial sensing and high throughput data collection across numerous OOCs simultaneously, offering high-content, spatiotemporal optical sensing to address current throughput limitations."
37-day microgravity exposure in 16-week female C57BL/6J mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11940681/,"Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.","NASA’s early systematic studies of spaceflight effects on rodent bone physiology were conducted in short duration Space Shuttle Space Transportation System (STS) studies lasting ten to fourteen days using the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) in a mid-deck locker. More recent results, with longer durations greater than thirty days on the International Space Station (ISS) use the Rodent Habitat hardware (RH), on the EXPRESS rack and broadly show relatively smaller degenerative bone losses possibly due to rodent acclimation to microgravity [ 11 , 19 , 29 ]. We acknowledge that other potential systemic changes in bone tissue [ 74 , 75 ] may affect mechanical properties of bone, but the data strongly suggest that increased activity and microgravity have opposite effects on bone health parameters only at specific locations within weight bearing bone and no significant effects in bones primarily loaded by muscle tension, as long as the habitat used, such as RH, is permissive of physical activity in space."
Effects of Space Flight on Inflammasome Activation in the Brain of Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11941215/,"C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups.","In addition, a previous study has shown that following 13 days of spaceflight on board of space shuttle mission STS-118, mice experienced a decrease in liver, spleen and thymus mass compared to the ground control group, which was consistent with the decreased number of lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophage and granulocytes [ 69 ]. Previous studies from RR-1 have shown that these mice experienced increased expression of genes associated with non-shivering thermogenesis in interscapular brown adipose tissue as well as increased expression of genes associated with glucose metabolism and adipogenesis in gonadal white adipose tissue [ 73 ], consistent with other studies that showed altered liver [ 74 ] and muscle metabolism in these mice, which suggested that these mice experienced muscle atrophy [ 75 ] and that dietary changes might have been needed as a countermeasure [ 76 ]. A recent study in a model of the lung vascular network exposed to low levels of radiation ranging from 0.25 to 1 Gy [ 83 ] showed increased expression of the inflammasome sensor NLRP3, which was decreased by treatment with LGM2605, a scavenger of radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and active chlorine species (ACS), which is capable of reducing ionizing species due to radiation [ 59 ]."
Immunization induces inflammation in the mouse heart during spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11892206/,"The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight. Keywords: Spaceflight, Microgravity, International space station, Transcriptomics, NF-κB, Immunization, Myocarditis, Inflammation, Heart, Cardiovascular system","Under these conditions, the combination of two hits in space versus one hit on Earth influences the cellular response, impacting the activation of signaling pathways and leading to inflammation. DNA replication (Figure S2 ), which was elevated in our study, may reflect an increase in cardiomyocyte nuclei number in the absence of cell division which has been reported in association with improved cell responses and survival during stress exposure [ 94 , 95 ]. The use of inbred mice and a defined immunization schedule over a specified amount of time should allow for reproducibility of the current findings and an expansion of the information gained here in mice of both sexes."
Analyzing the relationship between gene expression and phenotype in space-flown mice using a causal inference machine learning ensemble.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11748630/,"Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel.","As opposed to the non-specific pathways enriched by the EdgeR genes, the CRISP genes enrich lipid metabolism pathways including cholesterol, fatty acid, and NAFLD pathways—all of which are consistent with using lipid density as a response in our machine learning models. Future work could focus on randomized controlled experiments specifically designed to manipulate the function of each putative gene to verify they do, in fact, cause high or low lipid density in liver tissue. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) related to fatty liver, steatosis, and NAFLD could be explored to identify the molecular pathways responsible for the lipid density phenotype and to gain a more complete purview of the putative dysfunction."
Sex-specific cardiovascular adaptations to simulated microgravity in Sprague-Dawley rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11659408/,"We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in rats of either sex following HLU. The levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were lower in the aorta of SD females exposed to HLU compared with female controls but were not altered in males. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine without altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females ( n = 4 in each group) suggesting that lower GPER may contribute to arterial stiffening in the setting of simulated microgravity.","Arterial stiffness, pulse pressure amplification, and augmentation index were greater in women versus men in the Cardiovascular Abnormalities and Brain Lesions study, where the authors suggested that higher arterial stiffness may contribute to higher susceptibility of women to develop heart failure with normal ejection fraction 46 . The return of cardiovascular system to normal functioning after spaceflight may be delayed by lower vasoconstriction of peripheral arteries in those who developed arterial stiffness emphasizing the need for longitudinal assessment of sex-specific risk of cardiovascular events in astronauts with arterial stiffness following long-term spaceflights 47 , 48 . In addition, the intracarotid pulse wave velocities were similar between male and female GPER knockout mice, however the response to angiotensin II showed greater increases in elastin and smooth muscle but less collagen deposition in male GPER knockout mice versus females revealing sex differences in vascular remodeling 67 ."

By fostering global collaboration through its analysis working groups and training programs, the open science data repository promotes widespread engagement in space biology, ensuring transparency and inclusivity in research. It supports the global scientific community in advancing our understanding of spaceflight's impact on biological systems, ensuring humans will thrive in future deep space missions.","Especially as humanity nears returning to the Moon, this finding underscores the urgent need for a paradigm shift towards open science in space biology and aerospace medicine, an essential shift required to develop health countermeasures and conduct space biological research. Such practices not only show a shared commitment to centralizing valuable datasets between the scientific community and commercial space sectors but also enhance our ability to compare human, animal, microbial, plant and other data to deepen our understanding of space biology. To conclude, as humanity has entered the ‘Second Space Age’ ( 88 ), a central goal for the future of OSDR has evolved from FAIR data and metadata to the FAIREST principles, standing for more Engagement, more Social connections, and more Trust in its quality and stewardship ( 89 )."
Artificial gravity attenuates the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in the optic nerve and retina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11593819/,"The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. Keywords: spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), optic nerve, retina, RNA-seq, artificial gravity","As a potential preventive approach, optimal centrifugation prescriptions may modulate the normal tissue response to spaceflight conditions or increase the tolerance of the retina and optic nerves to injuries. The cellular components and structure of the ON and RTN are notably different in terms of cell types, astrocytic features, vascular density, and metabolic activity, as well as permeability and blood barrier properties [ 12 ]. Reduced 4-HNE staining on Müller cells by higher doses of AG may indicate protective effects against the impact of MG on the retina by mechanisms of attenuating oxidative stress and altering Müller glial activation and gliosis processes."
Effect of simulated cosmic radiation on cytomegalovirus reactivation and lytic replication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11477029/,"Abstract Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV.","The GCR Simulator Project at NSRL generates an accelerator-based spectrum of energies that closely approximate those that are known to make up the shielded GCR environment in space, thus providing a unique Earthbound system to test CMV reactivation in culture for spaceflight applications. On the contrary, our previous studies showed that gamma rays were more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of lytic gene transcription of EBV. In the current study, viral genomic comparison of pre-radiation, Day 6, Day 12, GCRsim, and proton samples did not reveal significant differences; however, transcriptomic analysis revealed differentially expressed genes when comparing the GCRsim-Day6 cells with mock-exposed cells ( Supplemental Document S2 )."
Protein kinase 2 of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 regulates mitochondrial morphology and function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11487192/,"Abstract UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4.","elegans muscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolic activity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscle performance. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 required for fission, the morphology of indirect flight muscle resembled leg muscle with myofibrils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mitochondria located inside. After exercising mice for 1 h, the authors found that mitochondria were fragmented, total Drp1 and activated Drp1 were increased, oxidative stress was not increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained, pro-mitophagy proteins decreased, and mitochondrial respiration was increased."

Adaptation to space conditions of novel bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station revealed by functional gene annotations and comparative genome analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11451251/,"Abstract Background The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","The pool of novel genes unique to the ISS species (Supplementary Table S13 ) showed an abundance of genes related to peptide and small molecule synthesis, transmembrane secretion/transport, and mechanosensitive ion channels. vandeheii genome showcasing the most substantial presence of MGEs. On the other hand, transposable elements were not detected in all ISS species, thus suggesting that TE-mediated genome rearrangements are not a common route for genomic adaptations to space environment. Given that microgravity and hypoosmotic shock may induce dessication stress, the adaptation mechanisms may be similar to dessication-tolerant organisms, e.g., bdelloid rotifers, where TEs are highly diverged [ 49 ] and containing unique ORFs, thus indicating a domestication."
Celebrating 30 years of access to NASA space life sciences data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11403809/,"Abstract NASA’s space life sciences research programs established a decades-long legacy of enhancing our ability to safely explore the cosmos. From Skylab and the Space Shuttle Program to the NASA Balloon Program and the International Space Station National Lab, these programs generated priceless data that continue to paint a vibrant picture of life in space. These data are available to the scientific community in various data repositories, including the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and NASA GeneLab. Keywords: space biology, NASA, data, open science, data archive, FAIR, omics","A paradigm shift has occurred in modern space biosciences, where reliable data reuse is now essential, as well as science being interdisciplinary, inclusive, and maximally transparent. To enable large communities of scientists on Earth to participate in spaceflight discovery, NASA plays a leading role in this shift through a strong open science program. NASA OSDR is a growing star in this ecosystem, with the integration of 2 critical databases, and the scientific output shows that its whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
Predicting how varying moisture conditions impact the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11386075/,"Abstract Background The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Results Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.","Due to these many potential sources of daily elevated moisture conditions, it is critical to understand how fungal and bacterial communities in spacecraft dust will react when receiving ideal growth conditions, namely water availability, and how this can affect crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection plans. For future missions, especially beyond low-Earth orbit, understanding the microbes present and how they may grow will be essential to mitigate any potential negative impacts on crew health and safety due to microbial-related illness or material degradation. The results are also affected by the dust sampling protocol for returned vacuum bags, which were triple-sealed and stored at room temperature while awaiting return to Earth in which time microbial communities may have been altered."
Spaceflight alters host-gut microbiota interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11362537/,"Abstract The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis . Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility.","The commonalities between LAR and ISS mice groups and use of distinct metagenomic methodologies, 16 S rRNA gene barcoding and co-assembled WMS, helped provide some biological and technical confidence in the spaceflight-associated changes in microbiome species detected here; however, it is likely that low n reduced statistical power and that important microbiome associations were missed, particularly those of low abundance bacteria. It is important that the imminent commercial low Earth orbit destinations (CLDs), Gateway, and Lunar Base Camp increase the capacity of their experimental habitats and growth facilities to support replicate numbers for multiomic science, in order to maximise discoveries and enable future interventional microbiome studies. The addition of untargeted serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened this research and future studies should aim to quantitatively profile the specific deconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the system."
Discoveries from human stem cell research in space that are relevant to advancing cellular therapies on Earth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11339457/,"Abstract Stem cell research performed in space has provided fundamental insights into stem cell properties and behavior in microgravity including cell proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration capabilities. However, there is broader scientific value to this research including potential translation of stem cell research in space to clinical applications. Here, we present important discoveries from different studies performed in space demonstrating the potential use of human stem cells as well as the limitations in cellular therapeutics. A full understanding of the effects of microgravity in space on potentially supporting the expansion and/or enhancement of stem cell function is required to translate the findings into clinics.","[Conclusion Not Found; Full Article Summary]: © The Author(s) 2024 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License, which permits any non-commercial use, sharing, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if you modified the licensed material. Results collected via gene expression profiling from the experiment “Stroma-2” performed aboard the ISS showed that in-space mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs had higher expression of genes involved in neural development, neuron morphogenesis, and transmission of nerve impulse and synapse than MSCs grown on Earth 24 . In addition to this, a study which analyzed peripheral blood samples from six astronauts who had participated in spaceflight missions found significant changes in several cell populations at different time points, including HSCs. The changes to lineage cells and HSCs were further studied in a mouse model, using hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, and found a reduction in frequency of NK cells, B cells, and erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow and increase in frequency of T cells, neutrophils, and HSCs. Deep sequencing showed changes in the expression of regulatory molecules important for the differentiation of HSCs, and hence, their findings demonstrated that spaceflight and simulated microgravity may disrupt the homeostasis of immune system and cause dynamic changes to both HSCs and lineage cells 37 . Research has shown that stem cells exposed to simulated cosmic galactic cosmic ray (GCR) radiation or solar energetic particles (SEP) experience dramatic changes in their differentiation potential and report increased apoptosis, delayed DNA repair, DNA damage and mutations which may lead to leukemic transformation within the hematopoietic system 67 – 69 . Returning to Earth: requirements and considerations for in-space stem cell use in patients While stem cell research in space provides valuable insights into effects of the spaceflight environment on their behavior, including both benefits and existing challenges, their therapeutic translation requires establishing standard safety and functionality protocols and suitable regulatory approvals."
Simulated microgravity impairs human NK [natural killer] cell cytotoxic activity against space radiation-relevant leukemic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11324864/,"Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.","The fact that a significant further decrease in killing was not observed in continuous sμG when K-562 cells were used as targets raises the possibility that the exclusive use of this optimized target cell line with its exquisite sensitivity to NK lysis has the potential to mask important yet subtle effects various stressors may exert on NK function and highlights the importance of including additional target cell lines in future studies. When combined with our prior report of human T-ALL in mice repopulated with human HSC that had been exposed to Mars mission-equivalent doses of GCR ions 13 , the further reduction in cytotoxicity of primary human NK cells against T-ALL when maintained in conditions of sμG raises the troubling possibility that the combined exposure to space radiation and conditions of microgravity may have the potential to increase astronaut risk of this hematological malignancy, and perhaps others, during prolonged missions beyond LEO. Importantly from the standpoint of astronaut safety, RNA-seq analysis performed on primary NK cells from two different healthy human donors revealed that multiple pathways that are central to NK function are altered by exposure to sμG, paving the way for future studies to test agents designed to target these specific pathways to serve as much-needed medical countermeasures that can mitigate the microgravity-induced deficits in NK function, enabling astronaut immune systems to effectively recognize and eliminate any malignant clones that arise as a result mutations induced by exposure to space radiation."
Simulated microgravity alters gene regulation linked to immunity and cardiovascular disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11353732/,"Abstract Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.","In Earth-based cardiovascular disease, altered fluid distribution and pressure changes can give rise to injury of cardiac tissue and therefore may play a role in the upregulated complement response seen in this rodent model for microgravity-induced fluid shifts. Bioinformatic analysis of tissues from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies (e.g., skeletal muscle, adrenals, kidney, liver) consistently show that spaceflight and its analogs lead to altered expression of circadian clock-related genes including Per2 , Arntl , and Clock [ 56 ]. Taken together, the overall transcriptomic signature in the left ventricle of older males at 14 days of HU (~1 human year) suggests activation of the immune system and pro-inflammatory signaling, altered expression of circadian clock genes, and induction of signals that promote ROS production together with upregulation of select cellular defenses to oxidative damage."
Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,"We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca 2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment.","[Conclusion Not Found; Full Article Summary]: © The Author(s) 2024 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE, also seen as BMX-001), an antioxidant that acts as a SOD mimetic 28 , 29 , could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction in the murine soleus muscle following 35 days of spaceflight. 78 treated rats with the SERCA activator, CDN1163, during hindlimb suspension (NASA’s simulated model of microgravity) and, while they didn’t measure SERCA function directly, they found improvements in several muscle parameters including soleus fatigue resistance, mitochondrial markers, and markers of Ca 2+ homeostasis. Western blotting Western blotting was performed on muscle homogenate to assess protein content for SERCA1a, SERCA2a, total and phosphorylated content of the Ca 2+ release protein ryanodine receptor (RYR1/2), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) as a marker of oxidative stress, SOD, and the three SERCA regulators, sarcolipin (SLN), neuronatin (NNAT), and phospholamban (PLN) as previously described 5 , 19 .
